to be met for an increasingly urbanized population, the majority of which is not agriculturally self-sufficient.</p><p>cea addresses a few of these concerns to varying degrees of success. by design, it is quite efficient with its use of land and space. farming using vertical space and without water loss from evapotranspiration is a wonderful benefit that could theoretically help meet our food demand within city limits, as well as reducing worldwide deforestation and freshwater depletion from agriculture.</p><p>however, the energy demand required to sustain growing indoors, especially when the outside climate is inhospitable to growing, can be immense. energy use is directly correlated with greenhouse gas emissions, since many electrical grids still rely on coal and even renewable energy systems necessitate manufacturing and the creation of waste.</p><p>cea also does nothing to address market factors of agriculture. food grown via cea is marketed towards wealthy yet environmentally-conscious consumers (if there can be such a thing) and remains only accessible behind the paywall of a grocery store shelf. of course, all of this means that cea is neither a complete failure on all metrics nor a be-all end-all solution to agriculture. as with anything, it&rsquo;s nuanced, and i tried to capture this in my paper.</p><p>unlike the <a href=/projects/materials/>previous course</a> i&rsquo;ve written about here, i really feel like i put my best foot forward this semester. for as much as i struggle with the prospect of being at college and feeling like my efforts are for nothing, i genuinely feel like i&rsquo;ve done meaningful work in this class. who would&rsquo;ve thought that reading academic literature about an actually tangible problem could feel rewarding.</p><a href=/>>> home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(o){var e,t,s,n=document.getElementsByTagName(o);for(t=0;t<n.length;t++)if(s=n[t],e=s.parentElement,e.childNodes.length===1){if(e.nodeName==='A'&&(e=e.parentElement,e.childNodes.length!=1))continue;e.nodeName==='P'&&(e.style.textAlign='center')}}for(var t=['img','embed','object'],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr><a href=/privacy/>privacy policy</a> | <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sebastianvydra/nothingtofear>song recommendation</a></footer></body></html>
