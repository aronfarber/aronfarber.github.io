My dad and I spent a couple of summers riding a section of the <a href=https://www.orangecountygov.com/1475/Heritage-Trail>Heritage Trail</a>, a rail-trail in Orange County, semi-regularly. I have very fond memories of those rides and they kickstarted what will presumably be a lifelong love of cycling.</p><p>In 2016 I started riding to school. Although the health benefits of biking are obvious, like so many other things in life, that wasn&rsquo;t the reason why I opted for it. I started because I thought it&rsquo;d be fun and it released serotonin in my brain every morning that made me feel happier. And while I am a fan of public transit, the MTA couldn&rsquo;t get me to school on time as reliably as I could.</p><p>Compared to trail riding, riding in the city is a completely different beast. In New York, even if you follow traffic laws you&rsquo;re constantly put in danger by parked cars and negligent drivers. It&rsquo;s well and truly dangerous, and I had to learn to love the
adrenaline rush.</p><figure id=me><img src=/images/bikes/smog.jpg><figcaption>A particularly smoggy day along the Hudson River Greenway.</figcaption></figure><p>In the summer of 2018, I did a bikepacking trip from Westchester, just above NYC, to Montreal, Quebec. It took a few weeks, and involved camping and carrying associated paraphernelia on my bike. I didn&rsquo;t train very hard and wasn&rsquo;t familiar with my equipment, so I honestly had a really rough time. In retrospect, I view it as one of my biggest accomplishments that I saw it through. The prospect of solo adventure is thrilling to me, and it&rsquo;s a goal of mine to one day go bikepacking again on my own and camp in the woods.</p><p>Shortly before college I ended up inheriting my dad&rsquo;s Trek ZX 2300, one of the earlier carbon-fiber road bikes to ever be manufactured. The riding position is intensely forward, especially considering I&rsquo;m about four inches shorter than my dad was. I quickly grew attached to the extra speed and lighter frame. It&rsquo;s a supremely fun bike to ride, and it&rsquo;s the one I regularly ride to this day.</p><figure id=me><img src=/images/bikes/eastriver.jpg><figcaption>A poorly framed photo I took, presumably while taking a break from a ride along the East River.</figcaption></figure><p>During college, while I lived in the dorms, I relied on a Bluebikes subscription, which is Boston&rsquo;s bikeshare program. Those bikes are heavy and cumbersome, but they were really convenient at a time when I had nowhere safe to store my own bike. I&rsquo;m glad such programs have gained prominence throughout cities, since they reduce the barrier of entry to urban cycling. Once I moved off campus, I brought my own bike and experienced true happiness again.</p><p>Boston is a sub-par cycling city. The infrastructure is actually half-decent, but since the urban layout of Boston is just endless sprawl, cars need to travel quickly to get anywhere. Thus, instead of fun cyclist-driver intermingling, such interactions need to be avoided at all costs because they almost always end in death.</p><p>This means, as a cyclist, you have to stay in the bike lane and you have to obey red lights. If not, instead of tempting fate with Uber drivers in Toyota Camrys going 10 mph, you&rsquo;re tempting fate with SUV drivers going 40 mph. That feeling of control I have over my own destiny while riding doesn&rsquo;t really exist in Boston. My riding style can be either unreasonably dangerous or frustratingly slow and restrictive.</p><p>During COVID, I went back to New York. On occasion, near the very beginning I&rsquo;d ride through Midtown while it was absolutely desolate. The first time I rode through Times Square, in the middle of the road, in no danger, was surreal. I felt powerful, but at the same time melancholic, at the state of the world. It was such a fantastic time to be a cyclist, and sometimes I miss those days.</p><figure id=me><img src=/images/bikes/me.jpg></figure><p>In 2021 I had a stint of doing food delivery on my bike, for one of the major apps. I lasted a couple of months until I had to go back to college, but I wasn&rsquo;t great at it. It&rsquo;s safe to say that, without an e-bike, I was not the most expedious courier. Entering random apartment buildings and interacting with strangers was also quite unusual for me, although by the end my comfort zone had undoubtedly expanded. I also made under minimum wage, but it definitely helped keep me active and sane.</p><p>In the summer of 2022, I did a study abroad program in the Netherlands focused on transportation infrastructure. We stayed in a smaller city called Delft, which is outside of The Hague. It was idyllic.</p><p>I spent most of my free time taking the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederlandse_Spoorwegen>NS</a> to random Dutch towns and cities, and either renting a bike and riding around or just walking around. I cannot overstate how incredible that was. The course content was also phenomenal, and I learned about many of the engineering principles behind both the designs I was familiar with in the states, and the new designs I was experiencing in the Netherlands. It was really one of the most valuable experiences of my life.</p><figure id=me><img src=/images/bikes/flat.jpeg><figcaption>Apologies to my classmates for getting a flat in the rain that one time.</figcaption></figure><p>I have complicated feelings about the experience of cycling in the Netherlands. In urban environments, most design principles are common sense for safety; lots of elevation differentials, slowing down cars when an interaction with cyclists or pedestrians is coming, having fully separated paths, that kind of thing. That increase in safety comes at the expense of some of the fun of riding, a sacrifice I&rsquo;d be more than willing to make here in the states.</p><p>Yet, I still had trouble assimilating. In cities, I didn&rsquo;t understand the flow of traffic among the cycle paths, and many merges and turns felt unnatural. I felt slow and would often end up having to backtrack or ride around a block multiple times. It&rsquo;s clearly superior infrastructure to the bike gutters we have here, but it&rsquo;d be a serious adjustment for me if we adopted it permanently.</p><p>In Delft, at least in the center, density is low enough that they just have cyclists, pedestrians, and cars on the same roads. Streets are narrow for cars so they travel slowly, and the mere presence of people on the roads reinforces slow speeds. I actually really enjoyed being in smaller towns in the Netherlands and just riding whereever I wanted. It invoked a similar feeling to when I rode through a desolate Times Square in 2020. Of course, that dynamic is completely unrealistic in the states, but I can dream.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also grown slightly disillusioned with the amount of people in the states who have started to idolize certain Western European cities and countries for their infrastructure. Such places prioritize public investment in infrastructure much more than we do in the states, which is good, but these are still individualistic and unequal countries. It&rsquo;s safer, but not egalitarian. A step in the right direction, but not an endgame, at least in my opinion.</p><p>Generally, I&rsquo;m a bog-standard urbanist and high-density zoning enjoyer. The amount of people interested in urbanism has sprung up in droves in the past few years due to a certain few popular Youtube channels, which is nice. I try not to proselytize or be obnoxious about it, it&rsquo;s just something important to me. My hope is that, as we age, my generation makes a strong push for density and public infrastructure in our neighborhoods.</p><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr><a href=/web-ethos/>Web ethos</a> | <a href=https://sebastianvydra.bandcamp.com/track/nothing-to-fear>Song recommendation</a></footer></body></html>
