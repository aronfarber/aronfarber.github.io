Coincidentally, I was already going back home to New York on the 26th, but when booking Anomalie tickets I chose to go to the Boston show because I had friends going, and I didn&rsquo;t need to see it twice, or so I thought. This time I was alone, but surprisingly was able to socialize with some other fans.</p><p>The show was exactly the same as the day prior, and almost as fantastic. It was interesting knowing in advance what came next, down to the encore. I still had an absolutely amazing time dancing along, especially because I had spend almost the entire train ride home rinsing his albums and felt even more familiar with the songs. See below for more general thoughts surrounding the first time I saw the show.</p><hr class=solid><p><b>Anomalie - Galerie Tour</b></br>May 25, 2022</br>The Sinclair, Cambridge</br>Openers: Bad Snacks</br></p><p>To preface, Anomalie is an indescribably fantastic artist and deserves infinite recognition for his talents. Not only is he an absurdly talented keyboardist, but his arrangements combining classical jazz concepts with modern electronic production are brilliant without fail. The namesake of this tour was Galerie, an album that I&rsquo;d recommend to just about anyone, even a self-proclaimed disliker of electronic music. Like so much of my favorite music, Galerie has a perfect confluence of being extremely fun and danceable while maintaining an artful atmosphere with unmatched musical craftsmanship. His previous project, a two-part EP/album series called Métropole and Métropole Part II, was more synth-focused with some heavy bass design, which I love about equally.</p><p>I went to this show with two close friends, both of whom have been pretty big fans of Anomalie for some time. Anomalie had toured North America in 2019, after the Métropole series was finished, but I missed it because I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of him at that point. That didn&rsquo;t matter in the end, because throughout the Galerie show he not only performed every full-length song on Galerie, but also almost every full-length song on Métropole <em>and</em> Métropole Part II. I was blown away that I got to hear him perform literally all of my favorite original songs of his.</p><p>Seeing as this wasn&rsquo;t really a dance music show, the atmosphere was unlike every other show I had attended before. Most people were listening more intently and there wasn&rsquo;t very much jumping or violent movement. I loved that, because normally I dance in place anyway. It felt fantastic to be able to sing and dance along to melodies and lyrics I had listened to dozens of times. It was nothing short of amazing.</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t too focused on the stage, but when I was, both he and his live band were true performers; you could watch any one of them at any moment and they&rsquo;d be doing something insane. Bad Snacks was brought back on to play violin for Hummingbird, which was great. For the entire show, Anomalie had his keyboard tilted down so the audience could watch him play. That must be difficult as a keyboardist, and it&rsquo;s such a small touch, but it added tremendously to the experience. After the show, we waited in a line to speak to Anomalie. All I told him was how awesome it was that he got to play everything.</p><p><img id=anomalie style=vertical-align:middle src=/images/concerts/anomalie.jpg></p><hr class=solid><p><b>Porter Robinson - Nurture Live</b></br>October 16, 2021</br>Orpheum Theatre, Boston</br>Openers: Jai Wolf</br></p><hr class=solid><p><b>Rezz - One-off show I&rsquo;m pretty sure</b></br>July 2, 2021</br>Avant Gardner, NYC</br>Openers: Shades, yultron, DNMO, Sara Landry, Dischetto</br></p><p>Somewhat irresponsibly, when a friend invited me to see this Rezz show after a year and a half of social isolation, I jumped at the chance. I had been through a phase in around 2018 where I really enjoyed certain midtempo artists like 1788-L and Kotek, but that was long in the past by this time. I was unfamiliar with Rezz and all of the openers.</p><p>I remember almost nothing about this show except that it was insanely long, like five straight hours of midtempo and heavy trap. I was desparate to experience live music, and despite all odds I still danced and enjoyed myself. However, my cardiovascular system could truly handle no more sometime during yultron&rsquo;s set (which was after Rezz, for some reason?), and I left halfway through after about four and a half hours of EDM.</p><hr class=solid><p><b>Subtronics - Cyclops Invasion Tour</b></br>February 13, 2020</br>House of Blues, Boston</br>Openers: LEVEL UP, Chee, Bommer</br></p><p>After seeing Good Faith Live, I simply threw myself at whichever live EDM show I had remote interest in that I could realistically attend. Subtronics is not an artist I&rsquo;ve ever liked; he&rsquo;s a Dubstep artist whose music is made to be played live which, to me, compromises the quality of the music. But I digress, this was at the very beginning of my Dubstep phase and this was what was happening in Boston. I also had tickets to see Dabin, another Dubstep artist I&rsquo;m lukewarm about, in April of 2020. That was subsequently cancelled for reasons unbeknownst to me.</p><p>This was the first show I attended alone. This ended up being funny because unlike almost every show I&rsquo;ve been to before and since, it seemed like people were there mostly for a night out with their friends and not because they were passionate about the music. I did a fair bit of awkward standing around.</p><p>Regardless, it was a fun show. A lot of mindless bangers. It was the first time I had experienced a show with several openers that pushed back the main act to at least two hours after the doors had opened. In some ways I preferred the openers to Subtronics himself, since the floor wasn&rsquo;t as crowded and they were all playing the same mediocre Brostep anyway. I left halfway through Subtronics&rsquo; set because I had exhausted all of my energy on the openers. These days I know that I prefer hearing songs I&rsquo;m familiar with at live shows, but I&rsquo;m still glad I went to this.</p><hr class=solid><p><b><a href=https://soundcloud.com/madeon>Madeon</a> - Good Faith Live</b></br>December 3, 2019</br>House of Blues, Boston</br></p><p>This show came at the perfect time for me. I had just moved to Boston for college, and as a newly 18-year-old electronic music fan, the world of live music was now my oyster.</p><p>The namesake of the show was Madeon&rsquo;s latest album, Good Faith, which was something of a departure from his electro/synthpop style from Adventure, his first album more akin to the sound exhibited in Shelter Live. Good Faith has more of a slow groove, a more restrained atmosphere, that didn&rsquo;t resonate with me as much. I went to this show with a (formerly online) friend who enjoyed this album much more than me. Still, before the show I familiarized myself with the tracklist and went with an open mind.</p><p>It was an absolutely fantastic experience. The balcony where my friend and I were seated was almost empty, so we stood up and went to the front for a perfect view. We were really able to let loose. Something about the live environment made the songs click in my mind. At home, they were slow and slightly underwhelming. Live, they were dynamic and unabashedly danceable. The show really bolstered my appreciation for Good Faith itself, and to this day I enjoy Good Faith much more than I did prior to seeing it live. He also played quite a few classics from Adventure anyway.</p><p>After the show we were on a high. People came up to us and commented that they appreciated our energy during the show. It was the first live show I had attended where I felt my inhibitions fade away almost instantly once the music started. I chalk that up to the combination of being with a friend who enjoys music to a similar extent that I do, and me not being with my mom. That energy was so exhilarating, it solidified in my mind that live music was something that I loved, and that I should pursue more of those experiences.</p><hr class=solid><p><b><a href=https://soundcloud.com/thewrld>WRLD</a> & <a href=https://soundcloud.com/smlemusic>SMLE</a> - Stranded Tour</b></br>March 22, 2017</br>Knitting Factory, NYC</br></p><p>This was another really special show for me. At this time I was a pretty diehard fan of Monstercat, so having an opportunity to see two of their artists collaboratively perform was really amazing.</p><p>In many ways, this was my first actual live electronic music experience. Shelter Live, which took place a few months prior, was more akin to a traditional concert experience (that tour has its own Wikipedia page, which says it all). While I was still riding high on the euphoria of seeing music I actually enjoyed, being at the Knitting Factory was completely novel from even that, and little did I know at the time, much more akin to the actual experience of seeing EDM artists live.</p><p>The show was all ages, but I had to be stamped and wristbanded to prevent me from going to the bar. I also had to be with an adult, my mom in this case. I vividly recall walking into the venue, little more than a relatively small room, and being confused that the stage was&mldr; right there. Before the music started, while the other attendees, who all seemed much older than me, were standing around socializing, I was cowering in the back talking to my mom. The atmosphere was pretty intimate; there couldn&rsquo;t have been more than 30 other people there.</p><p>Once the music began it was different. Based on the videos I took I was in the front, dancing. I was familiar with many of the songs and was able to truly lose myself in the performance. Both artists were clearly there to perform and it was much more than a DJ set. For WRLD&rsquo;s half, he incorporated live elements into many of his classics: he played the keys over <a href=https://soundcloud.com/thewrld/wrld-little-too-close-feat-veronika-redd>Little Too Close</a> and the <a href=https://soundcloud.com/thewrld/astronaut-champions-feat-harry-brooks-jnr-wrld-remix>Champions remix</a>, sang <a href=https://soundcloud.com/thewrld/wrld-fighter>Fighter</a> into a talkbox, and he even had <a href=https://soundcloud.com/ehiorobo/tracks>Ehiorobo</a> come out to perform <a href=https://soundcloud.com/thewrld/wrld-drowning-ft-ehiorobo>Drowning</a> live which is just unfathomably awesome in retrospect. That song is unbelievably good. I have fewer videos of SMLE&rsquo;s performance, but I recall Ruben playing drums and hearing some Future Bass IDs that I still don&rsquo;t think have seen the light of day. Of course, all three artists were on stage for the titular song of the tour, <a href=https://soundcloud.com/thewrld/stranded>Stranded</a>, which was fantastic.</p><p>That night, I was wearing a t-shirt with SMLE&rsquo;s logo on it. After they finished performing, they came down to the floor and talked to me. All I remember from the interaction is that they were both very positive and seemed happy to talk to a fan. That left a lasting impression on me, who had never interacted with an artist I truly respected before. SMLE are still releasing great music to this day (see <a href=https://soundcloud.com/monstercat/smle-oksami-nick-smith-cant-sleep-alone>Can&rsquo;t Sleep Alone</a>). They also <a href=https://www.grammy.com/artists/smle/189211>got nominated for a Grammy</a> in 2018 for some <a href=https://soundcloud.com/rounder-records/bobby-rush-funk-o-de-funk-smle-remix>random remix</a> they did which is pretty insane for a small electronic music duo.</p><p><img id=stranded style=vertical-align:middle src=/images/concerts/stranded.jpg></p><hr class=solid><p><b><a href=https://soundcloud.com/porter-robinson>Porter Robinson</a> & <a href=https://soundcloud.com/madeon>Madeon</a> - Shelter Live</b></br>November 18, 2016</br>Madison Square Garden, NYC</br>Openers: Danger, Robotaki</br></p><p>The first concert I attended of my own volition. At this point I was already well and true into the electronic music scene. As a rite of passage, I had already become well-versed in Porter Robinson&rsquo;s Worlds and Madeon&rsquo;s Adventure, two seminal synthpop/electro albums that shaped the underground EDM scene that I followed for the entirety of middle and high school. I have vivid memories of listening to Shelter on the bus ride home from camp in the summer of 2016 shortly after the song came out.</p><p>The vast majority of EDM shows are at least 18+, usually 21+. This was an all-ages show featuring two of my favorite artists at the time, which was a once-in-a-lifetime confluence for me as a budding 14-year-old electronic music fan. Honestly, seeing as I&rsquo;m writing about this almost 7 years after it happened, I don&rsquo;t remember what my actual motivations that led me to go to the show. I didn&rsquo;t love live music yet, but I guess I loved Porter and Madeon enough to convince my mom to take me.</p><p>I also don&rsquo;t remember much about the actual show. Looking at the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_Live_Tour#Setlist>setlist</a> now, it looks incredibly stacked, but I feel like I wasn&rsquo;t really dancing or singing along as I did at home, or as I&rsquo;ve learned to do at concerts these days. Instead I recorded a lot of videos, presumably because somewhere along the line a seed was planted in my brain that recording is what you&rsquo;re supposed to do at a concert (something I vehemently oppose today). The atmosphere was also somewhat restrained because we were in more standard event-style seating, not a general admission floor. Having been self-conscious about letting lose is also a possibility. The visuals, something both producers are somewhat known for, were stunning, but both my mom and I also ended up being sensitive to the strobe lighting that they used. That was an early lesson for me to always wear sunglasses to EDM events.</p><p>There was a girl, about my age, seated in front of us with her dad. Our parents facilitated some small talk before the show and it was pleasant. I believe her name started with an R. Needless to say, that&rsquo;s one missed connection in my life that would be very cool to resolve.</p><p>While I did enjoy this show, I see this as a landmark in my life more so than a concert I really liked. I don&rsquo;t really have any fond memories from the event itself, but I think it ultimately was the spark that ignited my love for live music. Porter and Madeon are true performers, with a fun and unrestrained stage presence. I&rsquo;ve seen them both again since this show, have continued to enjoy their music, and feel unendingly grateful to them for all of the ways they&rsquo;ve pushed forward both my live music experiences, and electronic music as a whole.</p><hr class=solid><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr><a href=/web-ethos/>Web ethos</a> | <a href=https://sebastianvydra.bandcamp.com/track/nothing-to-fear>Song recommendation</a></footer></body></html>
