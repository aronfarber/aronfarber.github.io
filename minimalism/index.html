It&rsquo;s important to me consume as little as I can.</p><p>Being anti-consumerist is mainly an environmental stance. As a species we love to extract from the Earth and pollute it without forethought. I contribute to that as a living being, but by using less I hope to lessen my contributions to climate change and the degradation of ecosystems.</p><p>Living simply also comes with financial benefits. Having few online subscriptions lowers monthly costs that add up over time. I eat pretty simple food most of the time and I drink exclusively water, which is cheaper than the alternative. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll save enough money over the long term to work less later on in life.</p><p>Also I&rsquo;m honestly just not the type of person for whom having shiny things brings me joy. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;ll indulge in a good meal sometimes, and if I do need a product I&rsquo;ll spend more for a nicer option, but those occassions are few and far between. Beyond that I don&rsquo;t really feel compelled to do fancy things like go on extravagant vacations or nights out often. I&rsquo;m content having a relatively old phone that I&rsquo;ll use &rsquo;till it breaks, upon which I&rsquo;ll buy another refurbished one. I have no need to live somewhere larger than a one-bedroom apartment.</p><p>I also practice a form of <a href=/minimalism>digital minimalism</a> where I try to heavily restrict the amount of online accounts and services I use. Aside from this website, I have a very limited web presence. I don&rsquo;t use social media. It&rsquo;s nice having control over how I&rsquo;m shown on the internet.</p><p>Having few passwords and accounts to keep track of makes using the internet a lot less stressful for me. It helps me not waste time on websites and platforms that I don&rsquo;t actually enjoy using. I&rsquo;m also conscious of my data, and don&rsquo;t like giving information about my interests or personal life to companies. It also helps avoid compulsive online shopping.</p><p>Even though I overshare on here, if a data harvesting advertising algorithm were to find this site and link it to my identity they wouldn&rsquo;t make any sales off of me.</p><p>This all isn&rsquo;t to sound high and mighty. It just happened to work out that I prefer living this way, and I actually have quite limited self-control when it comes to purchases.</p><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr>This website is <a href=https://github.com/thegithubrespectorhasloggedon/thegithubrespectorhasloggedon.github.io>open-source</a> | <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sebastianvydra/nothingtofear>Song recommendation</a></footer></body></html>
