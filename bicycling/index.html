I was involved in a couple of car accidents growing up, from which I developed anxiety about being in a car, constantly on edge and unable to relax.</p><p>This lended pretty well to growing up in <a href=/nyc>the city</a> where I could avoid being in cars very easily.</p><p>I always took the subway to school. Public transit is awesome because you can just sit there and do whatever you want while being taken to your destination.</p><p>At the start of high school I started riding a bike to school. Although the health benefits of biking are obvious, like so many other things in life, I didn&rsquo;t do it because it was the healthier choice. I started because I thought it&rsquo;d be fun and it released serotonin in my brain every morning that made me feel happier. And as a bonus I made it to school every day.</p><p>This lended really well to becoming an engineer and taking an interest in urban planning in college, since I already had a deep hatred of cars and experience with people-friendly transportation infrastructure.</p><p>People really should drive less. Riding bikes is really cool and good for you in many ways. Even a person like me can be healthy because of it. This also means that cities are also awesome because you can bike places.</p><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr><a href=https://aron.nyc/website/>About this website</a> | Thanks for visiting!</footer></body></html>
