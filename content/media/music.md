if i had to name my singular favorite thing in the world, i would say, without a moment of hesitation, music. i spend around 10 hours a day listening to music on average, and when i'm not, it's rarely because i don't want to and usually because i can't.

this page is meant to provide a cursory glance into my music taste and what music i like. i've sorted my favorite artists and songs into subcategories to give it some structure. i provide previews, but i implore you to stream/buy the music yourself if you enjoy anything that you hear. proceed with an open mind!

perhaps the style of music i listen to the most is one that can be broadly defined as "experimental". anything with unorthodox sounds or structure could feasibly fit into this category, but in practice it's usually just music with outlandish sound design or complex rhythms. i enjoy music that i structurally can't comprehend. i tend to dance with my hands and face rather than my body, which is conducive to more easily emulating off-beat melodies and rolling sounds. this is also why overly growly or fluttery sound design tends to resonate with me.

**quok/куок** - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/quok), [bandcamp](https://quok.bandcamp.com)

quok's music aligns perfectly with my sensibilities. off-kilter beats, frequent glitches and flairs of sound design, and nuanced song structures are all elements of his songs that i enjoy. his production usually isn't perfect, and oftentimes his english lyrics are rather odd. his discography contains recurring musical and lyrical motifs that persist across his various albums. in my eyes these traits are eccentric, but they only add to the character and uniqueness of his style.

nowadays, he mostly releases under куок, a russian rap alias that i still quite enjoy due to the presence of his production. he seems to be relatively popular in russia as a rapper, and he still maintains a decent following in the soundcloud scene from his days as an electronic artist. however, i do often yearn for another instrumental quok album, since his last one under the alias was [genesis](https://quok.bandcamp.com/album/genesis), in 2019.

**lalanoi** - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/lalanoi), [bandcamp](https://lalanoi.bandcamp.com/)

lalanoi's music is pure ear candy. everything he makes is completely beyond my comprehension, yet he somehow manages to combine some mind-boggling flows and arrangements into cohesive pieces. his songs have an insane level of detail that is not only incredibly impressive, but makes his music a delight to listen to every time. 

lalanoi is a mysterious producer from japan. since suddenly appearing in the scene in 2019, he has become a revered legend within the soundcloud community, and for good reason. his music never fails to bring me immense joy.

**ekcle** - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/ekclemusic), [bandcamp](https://ekclemusic.bandcamp.com/)

no producers were able to meld the realms of synthetic and organic sound as well as ekcle. while complex in structure and nuanced in arrangement, they always managed to keep their music sounding warm, inviting, and catchy. their frequent use of the [kalimba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbira) became an iconic motif cemented in their best songs. at one point, i'd probably have considered them my favorite artists, and their last ep [yoja](https://soundcloud.com/inspected/sets/ekcle-yoja) remains my favorite ever to be released.

ekcle were a duo from the uk. in 2020, they announced that they would be splitting, thereby ending the project indefinitely. the two went on to start their own solo projects ([tutara peak](https://soundcloud.com/tutarapeak) and [david gotham](https://soundcloud.com/davidgothammusic)), but i haven't enjoyed either of their individual outputs nearly as much as their efforts under ekcle. at least this way, they have cemented an incredibly consistent catalog that will maintain a legendary status within electronic music.

**culprate** - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/culprate), [bandcamp](https://culprate.bandcamp.com/)

culprate is something of an og in electronic music, and has been involved in the uk bass music scene since before the 2010s. much of his discography consists of old-school dubstep and a slow, bass-heavy subgenre called neurohop, neither of which i am particularly fond of. however, on certain projects, he brings a mind-bendingly intricate style of glitchy dance music that i just adore.

his second album, [deliverance](https://culprate.bandcamp.com/album/deliverance), is my all-time favorite album. it's a massive project featuring collaborations from dozens of other instrumentalists, and is the benchmark of the level of consistency and storytelling that is missing from the vast majority of electronic projects.
