if i had to name my favorite thing in the world, i would say music without a moment of hesitation. i'm an very intensive music listener. i spend up to an hour a day perusing soundcloud, i track my listening habits religiously, and i also compulsively hoard digital music. needless to say, i listen to a ton of music and have accumulated an extensive list of favorite songs and artists throughout the last decade of discovering music over the internet. 

this page is meant to provide an introductory glance into my music taste and what music i like. i've sorted my favorite artists and songs into subcategories to give it some structure. i provide previews, but i implore you to stream/buy the music yourself if you enjoy anything that you hear. proceed with an open mind!

each artist here has their own separate page on this site that you can access by clicking on their name. this is part of a [more extensive, wiki-style network of pages](/music/) on this website where i hope to cover my favorite music more thoroughly, but only for myself and those who are specifically interested.

perhaps the style of music i listen to the most is one that can be broadly defined as "experimental". anything with unorthodox sounds or structure could feasibly fit into this category, but in practice it's usually just music with outlandish sound design or complex rhythms. i enjoy music that i structurally can't comprehend. i tend to dance with my hands and face rather than my body, which is conducive to more easily emulating off-beat melodies and rolling sounds. this is also why overly growly or fluttery sound design tends to resonate with me.

[**quok/куок**](/music/quok) - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/quok), [bandcamp](https://quok.bandcamp.com)

quok's music aligns perfectly with my sensibilities. off-kilter beats, frequent glitches and flairs of sound design, and nuanced song structures are all elements of his songs that i enjoy. his production usually isn't perfect, and oftentimes his english lyrics are rather odd. his discography contains recurring musical and lyrical motifs that persist across his various albums. in my eyes these traits are eccentric, but they only add to the character and uniqueness of his style.

nowadays, he mostly releases under куок, a russian rap alias that i still quite enjoy due to the presence of his production. he seems to be relatively popular in russia as a rapper, and he still maintains a decent following in the soundcloud scene from his days as an electronic artist. however, i do often yearn for another instrumental quok album, since his last one under the alias was [genesis](https://quok.bandcamp.com/album/genesis), in 2019.

[**lalanoi**](/music/lalanoi) - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/lalanoi), [bandcamp](https://lalanoi.bandcamp.com/)

lalanoi's music is pure ear candy. everything he makes is completely beyond my comprehension, yet he somehow manages to combine some mind-boggling flows and arrangements into cohesive pieces. his songs have an insane level of detail that is not only incredibly impressive, but makes his music a delight to listen to every time. 

lalanoi is a mysterious producer from japan. since suddenly appearing in the scene in 2019, he has become a revered legend within the soundcloud community, and for good reason. his music never fails to bring me immense joy.

[**ekcle**](/music/ekcle) - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/ekclemusic), [bandcamp](https://ekclemusic.bandcamp.com/)

no producers were able to meld the realms of synthetic and organic sound as well as ekcle. while complex in structure and nuanced in arrangement, they always managed to keep their music sounding warm, inviting, and catchy. their frequent use of the [kalimba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbira) became an iconic motif cemented in their best songs. at one point, i'd probably have considered them my favorite artists, and their last ep [yoja](https://soundcloud.com/inspected/sets/ekcle-yoja) remains my favorite ever to be released.

ekcle were a duo from the uk. in 2020, they announced that they would be splitting, thereby ending the project indefinitely. the two went on to start their own solo projects ([tutara peak](https://soundcloud.com/tutarapeak) and [david gotham](https://soundcloud.com/davidgothammusic)), but i haven't enjoyed either of their individual outputs nearly as much as their efforts under ekcle. at least this way, they have cemented an incredibly consistent catalog that will maintain a legendary status within electronic music.

[**culprate**](/music/culprate) - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/culprate), [bandcamp](https://culprate.bandcamp.com/)

culprate is something of an og in electronic music, and has been involved in the uk bass music scene since before the 2010s. much of his discography consists of old-school dubstep and a slow, bass-heavy subgenre called neurohop, neither of which i am particularly fond of. however, on certain projects, he brings a mind-bendingly intricate style of glitchy dance music that i just adore.

his second album, [deliverance](https://culprate.bandcamp.com/album/deliverance), is my all-time favorite album. it's a massive project featuring collaborations from dozens of other instrumentalists, and is the benchmark of the level of consistency and storytelling that is missing from the vast majority of electronic projects.

[emelka](/music/emelka) & [nyah](/music/nyahD) - [land of lanterns](https://soundcloud.com/sanctuarycollective/emelka-nyah-land-of-lanterns)

a dream collaboration from two artists i generally always enjoy, land of lanterns follows a brilliant progression through three vastly unique yet cohesive drops. something about the melody eratically jumping around in terms of both tonality and stereo field is endlessly entertaining to me.

<audio controls src="/images/music/emelka_landoflanterns.mp3"></audio>

[aleph](/music/aleph) - [mourn](https://soundcloud.com/inspected/aleph-mourn-2)

aleph is a producer who often uses [modular synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_synthesizer) to emulate the natural entropy of sounds in the digital realm. this generally creates distortion and artifacts in his music which are on full display in mourn. it feels so raw, and adds an atmosphere to this song that is just so somber and emotional.

<h3 id="heavy">heavy <a href="#categories">↩︎</a></h3>

"heavy" is a self-explanatory label for music. bangers, slappers, hits, whatever your preferred terminology may be. in my case, it usually means [dubstep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep). dubstep has a pretty bad rap among people who don't listen to it. it often gets ridiculed by mainstream audiences stemming from its frequent use as a comedic break in the early 2010s, during the height of [skrillex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skrillex)'s popularity (an artist whose talents i acknowledge but don't personally enjoy very much). however, dubstep is an unfathomably diverse and expansive genre, and it has improved significantly within the past two or three years. i've personally felt insecure about my enjoyment of the genre, and i hope that if you've stumbled across these songs as someone unfamiliar with the genre, that you keep an open mind.

[**sharks**](/music/sharks) - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/sharkstunes), [youtube (cool music videos!)](https://www.youtube.com/sharkstunes)

in my opinion, sharks is the best dubstep producer alive currently when it comes to mixing and production quality. his distinct ability to combine sharp drums with layers of insanely complex fluttery synths and basses makes his music hit incredibly hard. his frequent use of vocal samples adds flow and a factor of catchiness to his tracks.

until 2020, the french producer was a slightly above-average dubstep artist who i wouldn't have given a second look. since then, a unique shift in style, massive improvements in his production capabilities, and a very prolific output of eps has cemented sharks as my absolute favorite dubstep artist at the moment.

[**beutnoise**](/music/beutnoise) - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/beutnoise), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6f1dUhkKO0Nfz3X3Fdr09A)

the producer who completely revolutionized the genre of dubstep for me. the opposite of repetitive, his music is always chock full of crazy switchups and complex rhythms. his use of high-energy vocal samples adds character to his music, acting as recurring anchors to get me entranced in the flow. on top of that, his mixdowns are some of the cleanest in the scene, allowing for his creative ideas to shine through every song.

beutnoise, hailing from cuba, hasn't been releasing music for very long. his early music was very hip-hop influenced, a quality which has propagated throughout his newer music in the form of vocal sampling. his catalog is unbelievably consistent, and i have no doubt that he will eventually go down in history as one of the greatest modern dubstep producers.

[**hukae**](/music/hukae) - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/hukae/tracks)

hukae's tracks feature permanently awkward flows, barebones arrangements, and strange sound design. ultimately, the variation in his ideas, paired with pristine percussion selection, make each hukae track extremely interesting. each track features a slew of subtle choices, such as slight switchups in rhythm or a different snare for a single beat, that keep me engaged throughout every drop.

hukae is a british producer who concocted this unique dubstep style within just the last few years, previously being your average uk riddim artist. with the dissolution of [never say die](https://soundcloud.com/neversaydie), his main label that was generally considered a behemoth within the dubstep scene, i personally hope he makes the rounds within other og riddim circles and inspires other producers to add similar levels of nuance to their own tracks.

[kero](/music/kero) - [rainforest](https://soundcloud.com/rushdownrecs/kero-rainforest)

for me, stuttery delivery in dubstep is a guilty pleasure. nothing feels more momentous than a massive percussion hit and bass growl after a second of silence. kero incorporates this intermittent flow along with some syncopation in what is absolutely one of the hardest-hitting dubstep songs of all time.

in my case, in the realm of electronic music, "melodic" can still often mean impactful and bass-heavy. oftentimes melodic edm tracks have some poppy element, such as a vocalist or a repetitive hook. i also tend to enjoy [future bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_bass), which is probably the electronic subgenre with the most mainstream appeal due to its popularization by acts like [the chainsmokers]. don't worry though, i'm not generally into commercialized future bass and promise to put some more interesting melodic music on show in this list.

[**jkuch**](/music/jkuch) - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jkuch), [bandcamp](https://jkuch.bandcamp.com/)

jkuch has a style completely distinct from any other musician i've ever heard. all of his sounds are self-processed and he is often his own vocalist, giving his songs a distinct palette that is easily recognizable. his music generally falls under the label of lush and melodic future bass, but his discography is so diverse in ideas that he is easily one of the artists i have spent the most time listening to over the years.

in 2022, the american producer released his debut album, [specter's garden](https://soundcloud.com/jkuch/sets/specters-garden-album). it's definitely a more conventional approach to the singer-songwriter format, and i only enjoyed a couple of songs from it. ultimately, jkuch remains one of the most unique and authentic producers in the scene, and i have no doubt this will continue for the forseeable future.

[**candid oak**](/music/candid-oak) - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/candid_oak), [bandcamp](https://candidoak.bandcamp.com)

my go-to feel-good producer. candid oak's music strikes a perfect balance between complex, catchy flows and warm, comforting sounds. his songs constantly evolve, rarely staying in one place, making each song feel like an adventure. his organic and nature-inspired percussion, sound design, and vocal sampling are just so unique and never fail to inspire a happy mood within me.

candid oak only has 2 released songs under the alias. music like his is intricate and layered, which i can only imagine takes a considerable amount of time to create. the norwegian producer is not particularly active on online platforms. these only make the few releases we have from him feel so special, and the day he drops his next song will be all the more momentous.

genre-defining, masterful, and impactful are all words i would use to describle au5's music. his trademark combination of well-designed, rolling basses and rich melodic tones is easily recognizable among edm fans. he often utilizes dramatic vocalists to make each song feel grand and lofty. his sound design and mixing has become renowned, and his unique arrangements have spawned an entire recognizable style that many other artists have emulated in the edm scene.

au5 is an american producer with an incredibly diverse and expansive discography. throughout the 2010s, there is an audible progression in his discography as he refined his sound and technique. he's a mainstay on the edm label [monstercat](https://www.youtube.com/c/Monstercat), which i grew up listening to religiously.

doujin music remains a well-kept secret in electronic music, and much of it is still only distributed via physical cds at japanese music conventions. some doujin circles (equivalent of record labels) like [megarex](https://megarex.jp/) and [diverse system](https://diverse.jp/) began expanding to streaming services around 2020, making doujin more accessible to the west. mameyudoufu was always active on soundcloud and, as a megarex mainstay, has cemented himself as one of the most popular japanese edm artists among westerners.
