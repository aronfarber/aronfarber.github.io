if i had to name my singular favorite thing in the world, i would say, without a moment of hesitation, music. i spend around 10 hours a day listening to music on average, and when i'm not, it's rarely because i don't want to and usually because i can't.

this page is meant to provide a cursory glance into my music taste and what music i like. i generally, i listen to modern electronic music but i've sorted my favorite artists and songs into subcategories to give it some structure. i provide previews, but i implore you to stream/buy the music yourself if you enjoy anything that you hear. proceed with an open mind!

<h4>quok/куок</h4> - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/quok), [bandcamp](https://quok.bandcamp.com)

quok's music aligns perfectly with my sensibilities. off-kilter beats, frequent glitches and flairs of sound design, and nuanced song structures are all elements of his songs that i enjoy. his production usually isn't perfect, and oftentimes his english lyrics are rather odd. his discography contains recurring musical and lyrical motifs that persist across his various albums. in my eyes these traits are eccentric, but they only add to the character and uniqueness of his style.

nowadays, he mostly releases under куок, a russian rap alias that i still quite enjoy due to the presence of his production. he seems to be relatively popular in russia as a rapper, and he still maintains a decent following in the soundcloud scene from his days as an electronic artist. however, i do often yearn for another instrumental quok album, since his last one under the alias was [genesis](https://quok.bandcamp.com/album/genesis), in 2019.

lalanoi - [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/lalanoi), [bandcamp](https://lalanoi.bandcamp.com/)

lalanoi's music is pure ear candy. everything he makes is completely beyond my comprehension, yet he somehow manages to combine some mind-boggling flows and arrangements into cohesive pieces. his songs have an insane level of detail that is not only incredibly impressive, but makes his music a delight to listen to every time. 

lalanoi is a mysterious producer from japan. since suddenly appearing in the scene in 2019, he has become a revered legend within the soundcloud community, and for good reason. his music never fails to bring me immense joy.
