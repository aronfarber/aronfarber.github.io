My parents were divorced and lived about 90 minutes apart, so I spent a good deal of time in the car growing up. 

I was, and still am, very susceptible to motion sickness, and even the smell of cars induces nausea for me. I was involved in a couple of car accidents growing up, from which I developed anxiety about being in a car, constantly on edge and unable to relax.

This lended pretty well to growing up in [the city](/nyc) where I could avoid being in cars very easily. 

I always took the subway to school. Public transit is awesome because you can just sit there and do whatever you want while being taken to your destination. 

At the start of high school I started riding a bike to school. Although the health benefits of biking are obvious, like so many other things in life, I didn't do it because it was the healthier choice. I started because I thought it'd be fun and it released serotonin in my brain every morning that made me feel happier. And as a bonus I made it to school every day.

This lended really well to becoming an engineer and taking an interest in urban planning in college, since I already had a deep hatred of cars and experience with people-friendly transportation infrastructure.

People really should drive less. Riding bikes is really cool and good for you in many ways. Even a person like me can be healthy because of it. This also means that cities are also awesome because you can bike places.
