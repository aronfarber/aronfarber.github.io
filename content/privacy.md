However, this website does contain links to other websites and with their own privacy policies. I cannot accept responsibility for the privacy policies of external websites, so be advised to click links to third-party websites at your own discretion. 

For example, I love [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). It's probably my favorite website on the entire internet and I will link to it frequently on this website.
