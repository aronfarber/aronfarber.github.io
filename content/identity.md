title: Identity

Generally I place more weight in personal choices and self-expression than the immutable characteristics people are assigned at birth.

The things I identify with the most are my hobbies, interests, and personal views, many of which are detailed on this website. All of the below is just stuff I'm gonna go into because it's a personal website and doesn't matter too much to me.

So yeah, in case you are actually curious about my identity in the traditional sense, I'm 21 years old and a he/him identifier.

My nationality is American and my ethnicity is Ashkenazi Jewish. I'm very detached from these aspects of my identity. I'm not religious and I have no personal affiliation with the state of Israel. I'm also not patriotic nor do I participate in most common elements of American culture such as sports, car culture, partying, or red meat.

People are often quick to tell me that I "look Jewish", which is true, but sometimes I perceive that as anti-Semitic depending on who says it. Ultimately, for all intents and purposes, I'm just a white guy. Identity-based persecution is a real problem in every country in the world, and being a man of European descent in America isn't really an example of that.
