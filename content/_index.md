## aron online! (he/him)

<img id="headshot" src="/images/headshot.jpg" width="250" height="250">

i'm an engineering student at [northeastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University/). i believe that we are obligated to provide universal access to healthcare, housing, food, water, and the commodities necessary to foster a dignified existence for every living being on earth. my goal in this world is to contribute to creating public services that aid in meeting those needs in the form of infrastructure.

this website is typed entirely in lowercase because it's how i type in informal online settings such as chat rooms and text messages. the rigid conventions expected in academic and professional writing inhibit me from typing freely. rhetorically speaking, it's an attempt to foster a more candid atmosphere about the place.

thanks for visiting!
