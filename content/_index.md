i'm an engineering student at [northeastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University/). 

this website contains documentation of some of my personal endeavours and academic projects. it's a heavy work in progress.

my favorite things:
- music. one day i'll aggregate my tastes into a post here.
- [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). i have a love-hate relationship with its content, policies, and culture, which i hope to write about in a post sometime. 
- bicycling. it's my primary mode of both exercise and transportation. bikes are efficient in every way, and more people should ride them in cities.
- personal growth. self-reflection, exploring the built and natural environment, and developing new skills (such as hosting a website), are all deeply important to me. 
- infrastructure. everyone should have access to healthcare, housing, food, water, and the commodities necessary to live a dignified existence. my goal in this world is to contribute to creating public services that aid in meeting those needs.
