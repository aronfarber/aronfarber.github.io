I'm [Aron](/name).

Seemingly the first one in [NYC](/nyc) who wanted to make a [personal website](/website).

Favorite [media](/media) includes [music](/music), [video games](/games), and watching [Youtube](/youtube). 

I ride my [bicycle](/bicycling) everywhere.

I'm an underachiever and my life is [simple](/minimalism). I've still done a few [cool things](/accomplishments) in my life.

If you're interested in who I am for whatever reason, I have a page with limited personal details about my [identity](/identity).

Every page on this website has a link to it on this homepage. This site ain't much, but it's mine.
