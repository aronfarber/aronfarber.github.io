me:
- i'm 20 and i use he/him pronouns.
- i'm currently an environmental engineering student at [northeastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University).
- the contents of this website could probably demonstrate more about me than i could succinctly summarize myself.

this website:
- this is a centralized online location for my thoughts, projects, and reviews that i expect to be viewed sparingly.
- aron.nyc is a [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) built with [hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_(software)) using the [hugo-classic](https://github.com/goodroot/hugo-classic) theme and hosted via [github pages](https://pages.github.com) (but one day i'll self-host it). you may view the source code [here](https://github.com/thegithubrespectorhasloggedon/thegithubrespectorhasloggedon.github.io).
- this website is typed entirely in lowercase because itâ€™s how i type in informal online settings such as chat rooms. the rigid conventions expected from academic and professional writing inhibit me from typing freely, and i want to emphasize this website as a personal project and not a professional space.
