I tend to like games with a compelling narrative, repetitive gameplay loop, or unique design and concept.

Conversely, a game being difficult or competitive isn't much of a draw for me on its own. I don't enjoy FPS games or open-world 3D games. I'm generally pretty bad at video games and don't play to be the best. 

My favorite all-time game has been the same since I was 8 or 9 years old. Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. The game loop is extremely addictive and satisfying, and the game has so much extra content that you can play for hundreds of hours before running out of things to do; which is exactly what I did in my childhood. I recently played the game again and sunk a similar amount of time.

Not only that, but the story is fantastic. Getting emotionally invested in any type of media is rare for me but this game is a tear-jerker. It also has a phenomenal pseudo-electronic soundtrack that formed the basis for my current [music taste](/music), for better or for worse.

My second-favorite game is Papers, Please. It's just a perfect game. The gameplay loop of checking documents is so fun and well-executed. Narratively, you're forced to make difficult choices and assume a role you'd never expect to find yourself in. The atmosphere of the game is just perfect and I can never get over just how good of an idea this game was.

Unfortunately I've already played through this game something like ten times so I know literally every event and ending like the back of my hand. I got so good at checking the documents that the game is no longer challenging, but I still love the gameplay loop and will fire up endless mode every so often for fun. I even had the [world record](/accomplishments) for a timed mode in this game at one point.

Another game I sunk many, many hours into as a kid is Mario Kart Wii. The driving is fast and intense. The levels are really well designed and it's just satisfying to drive really good laps. Competitive racing has a surprising amount of depth and strategy within it.

The game is also very broken. There's a weird polygon exploit or checkpoint manipulation shortcut in almost every track. If you don't like the default tracks, you can literally hack your Wii to load in custom ones. People have made insanely polished custom tracks, and even entire new game modes. The game's community and history are very rich. There are [Youtubers](/youtube) like TWD98 who are still playing this 14-year-old game and literal fan-made online servers that people are using to play multiplayer to this day.

I also tend to like roguelites, a genre in which you play in "runs", completely distinct playthroughs of the game where you start from scratch but iterate on the gameplay loop each run somehow. My favorites are The Binding of Isaac and Slay the Spire, which are pretty basic picks, but the games are just really fun with extremely robust progressions.

There's rarely time to play video games these days. This is more of a trip down memory lane for me. But that's okay, I still really enjoy the [medium](/media).
