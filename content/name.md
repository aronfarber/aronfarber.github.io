The name Aron doesn't really mean anything. It's an unusual spelling of Aaron that my parents gave me because they felt like it.

It's supposed to be pronounced /ærɪn/ (like the a in "ash") but I guess Aaron is pronounced like /ɛrɪn/ (like "air-in") so I'm mostly called that. Language is fluid so whatever. Whenever people ask I tell them to pronounce it the way they normally would.

I think if I had a say at the time I wouldn't have come up with anything better.
