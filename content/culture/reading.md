historically, my reading for pleasure has been intermittent. it's a pretty big deal when i pick up and finish reading a book. i find that it's easier to commit the contents and message of a book to long-term memory if i write about it, so here's something of a reading log of what i've read since getting an e-reader in early 2021.

each title links to my more in-depth review of the book. spoilers ahead!
