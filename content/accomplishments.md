There aren't many. I don't really buy into the idea of being successful, and having a legacy isn't important to me. However, I'm not above bragging a bit about the cool things I've managed to do with my life.

- I once [biked](/bicycling) about 400 miles from Dobbs Ferry, New York to Montreal, Canada. It took a few weeks, and involved camping and carrying associated paraphernelia on my bike. 

    It would've been cooler if I did it alone, but it was part of a summer program with a group. I enjoy the prospect of solo adventure and one of my only ambitious goals in life is to one day go bikepacking on my own and camp in the woods.

- At one point I got the world record in Timed Course #2 in "Papers, Please", which is one of my favorite video games and the origin of my avatar on this site's [homepage](/).

    As of right now I'm tied for 3rd with a score of 44. The two people tied for 1st have 47. 47 is possible but would require extremely good luck on top of perfect play, so I haven't committed to attempting it yet. [Here's](https://steamcommunity.com/stats/PapersPlease/leaderboards/179544?sr=1) the leaderboard if you're curious (external link to Steam).

- I maintain a massive independent archive of [electronic music](/music) from Soundcloud. It's over 10 terabytes of audio files. Soundcloud EDM is fickle and songs disappear all the time, so I'm pretending to be a preservationist or archivist. Really I'm just a data hoarder. 

- I also know all of the flags and capitals of the world by memory. At one point I was really good at Geoguessr but the meta moved so quickly that after I stopped playing for a year my skill level was superceded by pro players.
