title: Web Ethos
---

This website is my centralised online presence. I try not to exist anywhere else. Realistically, I have no need for a public personal website. I don't have a company, brand, or social media presence to promote. I'm just a guy.

However, I do like doing this "kind of thing" in my spare time. I don't work in tech or develop websites for my job or anything like that. Just a random pursuit I did online because I wanted to. This webpage is kind of pointless but I hope that tells you something about me.

In terms of web philosophy though, there are a few principles I've tried to implement to make the internet an ever-so-slightly friendlier place. For one, it's simple, which is true of all of my own favorite websites. It's important to me that this website is friendly to all users. I'm conscious of data caps and I don't load any external web fonts or uncompressed images. This site doesn't employ any advertising or analytics. It also works without JavaScript.

Anyway, I hope you like the site.
