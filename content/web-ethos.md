title: Web Ethos
---

Realistically, I have no need for a public personal website. I don't have a company, brand, or social media presence to promote. I essentially just stumbled upon the world of static personal websites and wanted to give it a go. Ultimately I like to keep a low profile, and not share too much. This website is my only presence online.

I also don't work in tech or web development, and don't stand to gain anything personally from having a nice website. I've seen many personal websites of computer scientists, designers, architects, and even some mechanical engineers, but never a civil or environmental engineer.

Since starting this site, I've become a proponent of the simple web. Most web traffic is handled by large platforms that have unfortunately littered the internet with ads, trackers, flashy CSS and unnecessary Javascript. I love fast, rudimentary personal websites that people maintain just for fun or to share their passions with the world.  

This site doesn't employ any tracking, advertising or analytics. It also works without JavaScript. I'm conscious of data caps and I don't load any external web fonts or uncompressed images. I use Github Pages for hosting.
