For my [materials class](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/search/?P=CIVE%202260), students were assigned the task of designing and conducting a semester-long lab experiment to test the mechanical properties of a material of our choosing. Due to my [newfound obsession with keyboards](/projects/a-candid-keyboard/), I decided to test thermoplastics, as they are commonly used in keyboard switches. Ultimately, it was a valuable first foray into engineering lab work. Beieng able to interface with genuine lab equipment and use real data to write a scientific paper was a fulfilling experience. In the end I received a good grade, and came out on the other side of the project with an impressive-looking technical report, so it seemed suitable for me to highlight that here.

You may find my report in PDF form [here](/images/comm/CommProject_Final.pdf).

### Takeaways

I had some qualms with the administration of the project, and would do a number of things differently myself were I to repeat it. The main issue rests in the fact that the project was assigned alongside the entire course, so we began the semester having no prior knowledge about material properties or testing. The beginning of the semester was also when we were expected to choose which material we would be testing, at which point I didn't know whether such an experiment was even feasible or not.

Due to a shortage of equipment availability, I was assigned a [heavy-duty compression machine](/images/comm/machine.jpg) with a load capacity far larger than what a switch could handle. This unfortunately meant that my data wasn't as specific as I had hoped. Keyswitches are delicate, and the machine was mostly unable to detect the small nuances in displacement of the switches throughout the application of force. The yieds I extrapolated from the resulting stress-strain curves came from very slight changes in measured stess that weren't necessarily actually indicative of a yield. The limited granularity in force application also meant that I got essentially no linear elastic deformation from the switches, which I needed to calculate [Young's modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus).

I would've loved to additionally conduct fatigue testing of the springs inside various switches. This would entail by repeatedly applying stress to multiple switch springs until they fail. With that data, an [S-N curve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/s-n-curve) can be derived by plotting various points of stress vs. the number of cycles at that amount of applied stress that results in the failure of the spring. With an S-N curve, [Miner's rule of cumulative damages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/miner-linear-damage-rule) could extrapolate the amount of keypresses (based on the average human typing force) it would take to cause a keyswitch spring to fail. By the time I had learned of this in the course, the first halves of the papers had already been due.

At the end of the day, given the circumstances under which the project was assigned, I'm quite happy with the report I wrote. Regardless of the validity of my conclusions, I can confidently say the project has increased my level of experience with laboratory testing and reporting.
