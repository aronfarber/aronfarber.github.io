despite studying engineering, i think that it's often overemphasized as a panacea to the problems that plague our society. when a system isn't working properly, we resort to technology and innovation to fix the problem for us. there's no greater exemplification of this than the rush to geoengineer ourselves out of climate change. the current landscape of climate engineering includes technologies such as ocean fertilization and carbon capture that use chemical processes to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. while removing co2 does directly counter the greenhouse effect, thereby reducing warming in the short-term, it just feels wrong to take such a temporary and surface-level approach to combating the largest existential threat the human species has ever known.

climate change and environmentalism are issues that are certainly more societal issues than they are scientific. the academic consensus is already crystal clear on climate change, and it has been so for over 50 years. we know what causes it, how we can mitigate it, and what will happen if we don't stop it in time. what stands in the way are policies and economic systems that foster and promote infinite extraction, unsustainable consumption, and inefficient distribution. as engineers, our goal is to cobble together solutions that work within our current unsustainable framework. for the most part, we're actually really good at that. we've already created relatively efficient systems that can scrub pollutants, stifle emissions, or reuse manufacturing byproducts. however, as human beings, our goal should be to treat the problem at its roots. an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

in my [ecology & microbiology course](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/search/?P=CIVE%203430) this semester, we were given the opportunity to examine the efficacy of an engineered solution for ourselves. on somewhat of a whim, i decided to look into [controlled-environment agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-environment_agriculture), which boils down to growing crops indoors. the assignment was to conduct a comprehensive literature review of the technology and its implications not only on the environment, but also on current sociopolitical and economic structures. i quite enjoyed this project and did pretty well, so i thought it was the worth showcasing.

### takeaways

agriculture is an expansive subject that, while a necessary fixture to sustain human life, is so diverse in its potential implementations. currently, our market-based appoach to growing crops creates a culture of convenience to the consumer above all. customers buy meat, so we supply it despite livestock farming being a source of 200 teragrams of co2 equivalent emissions per year. customers like to have their fruits and vegetables throughout the year, so we supply them out-of-season by shipping from long distances and growing with pesticides and pollutants, regardless of the environmental implications. these demands "need" to be met for an increasingly urbanized population, the majority of which is not agriculturally self-sufficient.

cea addresses a few of these concerns to varying degrees of success. by design, it is quite efficient with its use of land and space. farming using vertical space and without water loss from evapotranspiration is a wonderful benefit that could theoretically help meet our food demand within city limits, as well as reducing worldwide deforestation and freshwater depletion from agriculture. however, the energy demand required to sustain growing indoors, especially when the outside climate is inhospitable to growing, can be immense. energy use is directly correlated with greenhouse gas emissions, since many electrical grids still rely on coal and even renewable energy systems necessitate manufacturing and the creation of waste. cea also does nothing to address market factors of agriculture. food grown via cea is marketed towards wealthy yet environmentally-conscious consumers (if there can be such a thing) and remains only accessible behind the paywall of a grocery store shelf. of course, all of this means that cea is neither a complete failure on all metrics nor a be-all end-all solution to agriculture. as with anything, it's nuanced, and i tried to capture this in my paper.

unlike the [previous course](/projects/materials/) i've written about here, i really feel like i put my best foot forward this semester. for as much as i struggle with the prospect of being at college and feeling like my efforts are for nothing, i genuinely feel like i've done meaningful work in this class. who would've thought that reading academic literature about an actually tangible problem could feel rewarding.
