This page is a summary of my thoughts on various types of media.

[Music](/music), [video games](/games), and [Youtube channels](/youtube) get their own pages on my site because they're my favorites. 

I have a fear of commitment when it comes to media. I rarely watch TV or movies. It's weird because I'll enthusiastically watch a 2-hour-long Youtube video but the idea of sitting down for a feature film with an infinitely higher budget and production quality is too much to ask.

However, I did watch Breaking Bad in high school and loved it. It's my favorite TV show from sheer lack of experience.

If I had to name a favorite movie I still wouldn't be able to. I haven't sought out a movie in years. I think I just have trouble suspending my disbelief and getting immersed in a story that I'm not interacting with.

Books are pretty cool, when I can make time to read them. I'm very visual about reading and tend to construct really lucid visions of the events of a story in my head as I read, which is enjoyable. Again, commitment issues hold me back when it comes to books, and I don't read as much as I should. Of what I've managed to read, my favorite book is The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers. I also enjoy short stories or novellas on occasion. 

Non-fiction I can do without because I'd almost always rather just read a Wikipedia article. There's no need for a grand narrative in most books that are supposed to just be factual. 

I don't read the news either. Being informed is nice (I do this sub-optimally through the Wikipedia front page and by talking to my mom) but also the 24-hour news cycle makes for an abundance of really low-quality journalism and it's more effort sorting through the rubble than I'm willing to put in.

Online media tends to be cool. Not just Youtube videos, but also blog posts, websites, and even forums if you can count those.

However, I don't watch Twitch or any livestream content. It's just too much especially when every streamer I care about uploads the highlights to Youtebe anyway. I'm also not into the parasocial thing; when I have watched livestreams out of sheer boredom I've stayed far away from the chat box.

I don't really care at all about art. The only observations I can make about a painting or a sculpture are, "looks cool", or more commonly in art museums, "what am I looking at". The history behind artistic movements can be interesting but that's about it.

The same goes for most interpretive media. Dance, poetry, stand-up comedy; not into it. Even books with overly symbolic messaging, like the Lord of the Flies type books I'd be assigned in middle school, are a slog for me. 

Theater and improv, while special to me because I performed them for quite a while, are still unpleasant to watch.

Another thing I don't watch is sports. I feel like I understand the draw of sports and why people are so invested in them, but I didn't grow up watching sports and don't have any of the requisite background knowledge that makes each game interesting. When contextualized, the history behind some sports and events can be fascinating. If every televised game had a story like in a Jon Bois production, I'd be a sports fan.

Oh, and I *promise* I don't like anime. Yes, I've tried watching it.

If I missed anything it means I care so little about it that I forgot about it.
