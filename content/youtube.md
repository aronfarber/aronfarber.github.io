Watching through my Youtube subbox is a part of my daily routine. For some reason, probably because I grew up watching it, I prefer Youtube to most other [visual media](/media).

My favorite genre of videos on Youtube are long-form narrative video essays. Of which my favorite creators include:
- Jacob Geller
- Solar Sands
- hbomberguy
- Philosophy Tube
- Summoning Salt
- EmpLemon
- LEMMiNO
- Folding Ideas

I also enjoy shorter more comedy-focused content that still has a message or informational component to it.
- GeoWizard
- Jon Bois
- Boy Boy
- NileRed

The aforementioned channels all produce content that takes a lot of time and effort to create, and thus they upload infrequently. Usually, on a day without a big video essay upload, I'll watch some long-form gaming content. My favorite gaming creators are commentary-focused streamers that upload highlights or segments to Youtube.
