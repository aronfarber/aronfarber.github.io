title: NYC

I grew up here and consider it my home. If all goes well I'll be living here for the rest of my days.

My great-great-grandparents emigrated here from the Soviet Union in the 1920s when [anti-semitism](/identity) was ramping up throughout Europe.

That story doesn't really matter besides the fact that I have an established familial presence in the city and I have the uncommon opportunity to live here into adulthood without paying exorbitant rent.

It's a sub-optimal place for me in many ways. I'm sensitive to smell and loud noise. I also have minimal interest in the city's landmarks or culture to begin with.

The reason why I'm staying here is that I [refuse to drive cars](/bicycling), and New York City lets me keep that up. This way, I don't have to go through the trouble of expatriating to the Netherlands.

Big dense cities are also more efficient and less extractive on nature, so on principle I think it's a good place to live.

So yeah, it's a great city and I'm fortunate to be able to live here.
