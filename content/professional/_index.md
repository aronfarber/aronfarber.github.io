In progress

<!--I'm an environmental engineer currently working in brownfield remediation. I enjoy working on infrastructure and contaminated sites. I have my EIT certification and am hoping to get my PE a few years down the road.

I got my BS in Environmental Engineering from [Northeastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University). My education was pretty well-rounded, and I have a solid foundation in water treatment, environmental chemistry, microbiology, and air quality modeling.

I'm *not* looking for work at the moment, but if/when I am I will update this page with a resume, contact information, and some sample work.-->
