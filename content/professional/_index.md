I'm an Environmental Engineering student at [Northeastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University). I graduate in May 2024. You may view my program requirements [here](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/engineering/civil-environmental/environmental-engineering-bsenve/#programrequirementstext) if you wish.

At the moment, I'm studying for the FE exam and hope to have my EIT certification before I graduate.

I'm *not* looking for work at the moment, but if/when I do I will update this page with a resume, contact information, and some sample projects.
