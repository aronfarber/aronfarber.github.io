I'm currently a staff engineer working in land development and brownfield remediation. I have experience in environmental investigations, field sampling, air monitoring, construction oversight, and regulatory reporting. I have my EIT certification, and am hoping to get my PE upon obtaining the requisite experience.

I graduated with a BS in Environmental Engineering from [Northeastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University) in 2024. My education was well-rounded, and I have an academic foundation in water treatment systems, environmental chemistry, energy, microbiology, and air quality modeling.

My engineering-related interests include contaminated sites, infrastructure design, and building science. 

I'm *not* looking for other work at the moment.
