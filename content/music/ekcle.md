no producers were able to meld the realms of synthetic and organic sound as well as ekcle. while complex in structure and nuanced in arrangement, they always managed to keep their music sounding warm, inviting, and catchy. their frequent use of the [kalimba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbira) became an iconic motif cemented in their best songs. at one point, i'd probably have considered them my favorite artists, and their last ep [yoja](https://soundcloud.com/inspected/sets/ekcle-yoja) remains my favorite ever to be released.

in 2020, ekcle announced that they would be splitting, thereby ending the project indefinitely. the two went on to start their own solo projects ([tutara peak](https://soundcloud.com/tutarapeak) and [david gotham](https://soundcloud.com/davidgothammusic)), but i haven't enjoyed either of their individual outputs nearly as much as their efforts under ekcle. at least this way, they have cemented an incredibly consistent catalog that will maintain a legendary status within electronic music.
