jkuch has a style completely distinct from any other musician i've ever heard. all of his sounds are self-processed and he is often his own vocalist, giving his songs a distinct palette that is easily recognizable. his music generally falls under the label of lush and melodic future bass, but his discography is so diverse in ideas that he is easily one of the artists i have spent the most time listening to over the years.

in 2022, jkuch released his debut album, [specter's garden](https://soundcloud.com/jkuch/sets/specters-garden-album). it's definitely a more conventional approach to the singer-songwriter format, and i only enjoyed a couple of songs from it. ultimately though, jkuch remains one of the most unique and authentic producers in the scene, and i have no doubt this will continue for the forseeable future.
