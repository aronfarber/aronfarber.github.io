hukae's tracks feature permanently awkward flows, barebones arrangements, and strange sound design. ultimately, the variation in his ideas, paired with pristine percussion selection, make each hukae track extremely interesting. each track features a slew of subtle choices, such as slight switchups in rhythm or a different snare for a single beat, that keep me engaged throughout every drop.

hukae concocted this unique dubstep style within just the last few years, previously being your average uk riddim artist. with the dissolution of [never say die](https://soundcloud.com/neversaydie), his main label that was generally considered a behemoth within the dubstep scene, i personally hope he makes the rounds within other og riddim circles and inspires other producers to add similar levels of nuance to their own tracks.
