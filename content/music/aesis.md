aesis produced my favorite remix of the entirety of disciple's ["second biggest remix competition of all time"](https://soundcloud.com/disciple/sets/tsbrcoat) at the age of 13, making him a [prodigy](/music/prodigies/) in my view. while he did not win, he continues to produce exceptionally boomy dubstep that i really like. his music is filled with ear candy and interesting sound effects, and his flows are unbelievably hard-hitting.
