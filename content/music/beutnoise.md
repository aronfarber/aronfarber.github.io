the producer who completely revolutionized the genre of dubstep for me. the opposite of repetitive, his music is always chock full of crazy switchups and complex rhythms. his use of high-energy vocal samples adds character to his music, acting as recurring anchors to get me entranced in the flow. on top of that, his mixdowns are some of the cleanest in the scene, allowing for his creative ideas to shine through every song. his [kong ep](https://soundcloud.com/beutnoise/sets/beutnoise-kong-ep-out-on) is my favorite dubstep ep.

beutnoise, hailing from cuba, hasn't been releasing music for very long. his early music was very hip-hop influenced, a quality which has propagated throughout his newer music in the form of vocal sampling. his catalog is unbelievably consistent, and i have no doubt that he will eventually go down in history as one of the greatest modern dubstep producers.
