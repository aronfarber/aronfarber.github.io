my go-to feel-good producer. candid oak's music strikes a perfect balance between complex, catchy flows and warm, comforting sounds. his songs constantly evolve, rarely staying in one place, making each song feel like an adventure. his organic and nature-inspired percussion, sound design, and vocal sampling are just so unique and never fail to inspire a happy mood within me.

candid oak only has 2 released songs under the alias. music like his is intricate and layered, which i can only imagine takes a considerable amount of time to create. the norwegian producer is not particularly active on online platforms. these only make the few releases we have from him feel so special, and the day he drops his next song will be all the more momentous.
