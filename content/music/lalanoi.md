lalanoi's music is pure ear candy. everything he makes is completely beyond my comprehension, yet he somehow manages to combine some mind-boggling flows and arrangements into cohesive pieces. his songs have an insane level of detail that is not only incredibly impressive, but makes his music a delight to listen to every time. 

lalanoi is a mysterious producer from japan. since suddenly appearing in the soundcloud and doujin music scenes in 2019, he has become a revered legend within the soundcloud community, and for good reason. his music never fails to bring me immense joy.
