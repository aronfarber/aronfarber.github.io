genre-defining, masterful, and impactful are all words i would use to describle au5's music. his trademark combination of well-designed, rolling basses and rich melodic tones is easily recognizable among edm fans. he often utilizes dramatic vocalists to make each song feel grand and lofty. his sound design and mixing has become renowned, and his unique arrangements have spawned an entire recognizable style that many other artists have emulated in the edm scene.

au5 is an american producer with an incredibly diverse and expansive discography. throughout the 2010s, there is an audible progression in his music as he refined his sound and technique. he's a mainstay on the edm label [monstercat](https://www.youtube.com/c/Monstercat), which i grew up listening to religiously.
