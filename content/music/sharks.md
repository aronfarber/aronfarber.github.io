in my opinion, sharks is the best dubstep producer alive currently when it comes to mixing and production quality. his distinct ability to combine sharp drums with layers of insanely complex fluttery synths and basses makes his music hit incredibly hard. his frequent use of vocal samples adds flow and a factor of catchiness to his tracks.

until 2020, the french producer was a slightly above-average dubstep artist who i wouldn't have given a second look. since then, a unique shift in style, massive improvements in his production capabilities, and a very prolific output of eps has cemented sharks as my absolute favorite dubstep artist at the moment.
