child prodigies have always been a persistent phenomenon in any talent-driven space. when it comes to music, i'm of the belief that prodigies are the result of some combination of natural talent and early exposure to music in some form. mozart, chopin, and liszt were classical composers who achieved such a status in their contemporary fields of classical music before the age of 10. 

of course, exposure to an artistic medium is prerequisite to attaining prodigial levels of skill. when it comes to electronic music, children are generally restricted from using computers heavily at a young age, and are generally less adept with social media-esque platforms that provide spaces for young people to share their creations. these platforms are also required to have clauses in their terms of use against users under a certain age holding accounts (this age varies by jurisdiction but is generally 13), which probably deters young musicians from sharing their work to at least some extent. i think it's also true that most young musicians are introduced to music through various acoustic instruments or the music of their families, and switch to digital music production later during teenage years as they become exposed to online culture, and by extension, electronic music. 

as a result of all of these factors, most young electronic musicians enter the scene at 13 and above. i consider a young prodigy in the space of electronic music to be around 13 to 16 years old. however, i expect that this may change as generations who grew up exposed to electronic music online begin having children of their own. this is not to discredit the fact that there is undoubtedly plenty of incredible electronic music being shared right now by younger musicians on platforms such as youtube and newgrounds that i have no idea about. 

it's important to note that while i view young prodigies as an interesting phenomenon, the vast majority of electronic musicians i enjoy are around my age. i don't enjoy these musicians' works solely because they were young when they produced them, and i don't view any artists' work as lesser or greater due to the age at which they produced the art. these are artists that i enjoy because they produced music i like, and happened to be exceptionally young when releasing it.

with that out of the way, here is a list of all of the musicians i think of as prodigies that i like enough to document on this site:
