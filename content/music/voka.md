voka is a very interesting melodic producer. i don't know much about them, and most of their tracks don't specifically resonate with me, but i really enjoy their style of experimental yet euphoric dubstep with metallic textures and tons of variations in flow. this combination reaches its zenith for me in [lumina](https://open.spotify.com/album/59zxQQkDfglCrQTKre3Dy4?highlight=spotify:track:1fY6eXxVDiAkpQCWhZRny8), a beautifully impactful track, especially during those stuttery breaks at the end of each section. for now they are an artist i'm following closely, and i expect that i'll grow to enjoy their creations even more with time.
