musically, quok aligns perfectly with my sensibilities. off-kilter beats, frequent glitches and flairs of sound design, and nuanced song structures are all elements of his songs that i enjoy. his production usually isn't perfect, and oftentimes his english lyrics can be rather odd. his discography contains recurring musical and lyrical motifs that persist across his various albums. in my eyes these traits are eccentric, but they only add to the character and uniqueness of his style.

nowadays, he releases under куок (pronounced just like quok), a rap alias that i still quite enjoy due to the presence of his production. he seems to be relatively popular in russia as a rapper, and he still maintains a decent following in the soundcloud scene from his days as an electronic artist. however, i do often yearn for another instrumental quok album, since his last one under the alias was [genesis](https://quok.bandcamp.com/album/genesis), in 2019.

born in 2000, i consider him to be a prodigy since many of his best songs were released during his early teens from 2014-2016. he has an incredibly expansive discography with at least ten albums between both of his aliases.
