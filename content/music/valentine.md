valentine is a disgraced electronic music producer. i consider her to have been a pioneer of what i call "soundcloud future bass", a brand of [future bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_bass) with more eccentric flows, abrasive sound design, and nostalgic sample choices than more mainstream examples of the genre. her lush, melodic style and frequent featuring of rappers on tracks always appealed to me a lot. she had copious collaborations 

in 2020, she hosted a collaborative [hyperpop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpop) project called fromtheheart, featuring other future bass legends such as [chuck sutton](/music/chuck-sutton), [knapsack](https://soundcloud.com/bringyourknapsack) and [underscores](https://soundcloud.com/underscores), as well as burgeoning hyperpop producers such as [jedwill](https://soundcloud.com/jedwill1999) and [fraxiom](https://soundcloud.com/fraxiom). i view fromtheheart as the symbolic end of the era of soundcloud future bass, since after the project's release, underscores and knapsack also transitioned to making hyperpop, leaving the genre without three of its main influences.

ironically, while the fromtheheart project bolstered the careers of several of its collaborators, it led to the downfall of valentine's. in october of 2020, multiple members[[1]](https://twitter.com/holidaykiss_/status/1316515633392168960)[[2]](https://twitter.com/MooreKismet_/status/1316529245405888512) of fromtheheart spoke out on twitter about how valentine was an exploitative collaborator. claims made in the tweets include misappropriating credit, withholding earnings from collaborators, and controlling creative decisions. since the original tweets were posted, valentine has completely wiped her online presence (effectively proving the claims) and hasn't returned since. thus, i won't link to any of her music on this website. obviously, you may seek out her music, but i won't be enabling that decision by providing links here.
