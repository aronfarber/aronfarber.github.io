culprate is something of an og in electronic music, and has been involved in the uk bass music scene since before the 2010s. much of his discography consists of old-school dubstep and a slow, bass-heavy subgenre called neurohop, neither of which i am particularly fond of. however, on certain projects, he brings a mind-bendingly intricate style of glitchy dance music that i just adore.

his second album, [deliverance](https://culprate.bandcamp.com/album/deliverance), is my all-time favorite album. it's a massive project featuring collaborations from dozens of other instrumentalists, and is the benchmark of the level of consistency and storytelling that is missing from the vast majority of electronic projects.
