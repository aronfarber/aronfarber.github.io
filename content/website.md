title: Website
---

I have no need for a public personal website, I just think they're cool. I don't have a company, brand, or social media presence to promote. I'm just a guy.

However I do like doing this "kind of thing" in my spare time. I don't work in tech or develop websites for my job or anything like that. Just a random pursuit I did online because I wanted to. This webpage is kind of pointless but I hope that tells you something about me.

In terms of web philosophy though, there are a few principles I've tried to implement to make the internet an ever-so-dslightly friendlier place.

It's important to me that this website is friendly to all users. I'm conscious of data caps and I don't load any external web fonts or large images. This site doesn't employ any invasive or monetized technologies such as advertising, analytics, IP logging or anything like that. It also works without JavaScript.

Anyway, I hope you like the site.
