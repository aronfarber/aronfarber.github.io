title: Minimalism
---

My life is simple. It's important to me consume as little as I can. 

Being anti-consumerist is mainly an environmental stance. As a species we love to extract from the Earth and pollute it without forethought. I contribute to that as a living being, but by using less I hope to lessen my contributions to climate change and the degradation of ecosystems.

Living simply also comes with financial benefits. Having few online subscriptions lowers monthly costs that add up over time. I eat pretty simple food most of the time and I drink exclusively water, which is cheaper than the alternative. Hopefully I'll save enough money over the long term to work less later on in life.

Also I'm honestly just not the type of person for whom having shiny things brings me joy. Don't get me wrong, I'll indulge in a good meal sometimes, and if I do need a product I'll spend more for a nicer option, but those occassions are few and far between. Beyond that I don't really feel compelled to do fancy things like go on extravagant vacations or nights out often. I'm content having a relatively old phone that I'll use 'till it breaks, upon which I'll buy another refurbished one. I have no need to live somewhere larger than a one-bedroom apartment.

I also practice a form of [digital minimalism](/minimalism) where I try to heavily restrict the amount of online accounts and services I use. Aside from this website, I have a very limited web presence. I don't use social media. It's nice having control over how I'm shown on the internet.

Having few passwords and accounts to keep track of makes using the internet a lot less stressful for me. It helps me not waste time on websites and platforms that I don't actually enjoy using. I'm also conscious of my data, and don't like giving information about my interests or personal life to companies. It also helps avoid compulsive online shopping.

Even though I overshare on here, if a data harvesting advertising algorithm were to find this site and link it to my identity they wouldn't make any sales off of me.

This all isn't to sound high and mighty. It just happened to work out that I prefer living this way, and I actually have quite limited self-control when it comes to purchases.
