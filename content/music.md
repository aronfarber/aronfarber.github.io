I listen to electronic music pretty much exclusively. None of it is the type of electronic music that's socially acceptable to listen to.

Here are five songs that encapsulate my taste well.

- Candid Oak - Grasp
- Culprate & Dexcell - Poison
- Distayne - Far Away
- emelka & Nyah - Land of Lanterns
- KERO - Rainforest

Potentially you'll like one of these.
