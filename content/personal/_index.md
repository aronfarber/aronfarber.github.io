My name is [Aron](/personal/name).

Core parts of my identity include [bicycling](/personal/bicycling), listening to music (both [on my own](/personal/music-taste) and [live](/personal/concerts)), and reading.

It's important to me to always be learning. Fields of interest include linguistics, philosophy, history, and political theory. As of late, I've been trying to shift my focus away from the accumulation of knowledge towards the application of knowledge in being a positive contributor to the world. 

I experiment with secondary hobbies pretty frequently, just to see what sticks. Some of the more fun ones I've tried include [keyboard building](/personal/keyboards), DJing, making [this website](/web-ethos), and video journalism. 

I'm a utilitarian and a minimalist. It's important to me to live efficiently, consuming and wasting as little as possible. To that end, I've also adopted some principles from stoicism and asceticism in my life.
