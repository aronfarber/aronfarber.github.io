My name is [Aron](/personal/name).

The principles I aim to follow throughout life are to contribute positively to the world, constantly explore new things and push my own boundaries, and embrace a simple, low-impact lifestyle.

My passions are [bicycling](/personal/bicycling), listening to music both [on my own](/personal/music-taste) and [live](/personal/concerts), reading, and writing.

I experiment with secondary hobbies pretty frequently, just to see what sticks. Some of the more fun ones I've tried over the years include [keyboard design](/personal/keyboards), DJing, improv, playing instruments, making [websites](/web-ethos), and video journalism.
