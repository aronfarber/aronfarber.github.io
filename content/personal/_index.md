My name is [Aron](/personal/name).

The goals that drive me in life are to contribute positively to the world, explore new things and push myself out of my comfort zone, and live happily and healthfully.

My passions are [bicycling](/personal/bicycling), listening to music (both [on my own](/personal/music-taste) and [live](/personal/concerts)), and learning.

I experiment with secondary hobbies pretty frequently, just to see what sticks. Some of the more fun ones I've tried over the years include [keyboard design](/personal/keyboards), tennis, DJing, playing instruments, making [websites](/web-ethos), and video journalism.
