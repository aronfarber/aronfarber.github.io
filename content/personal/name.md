title: Name

My name doesn't hold any particular significance. It's an unusual spelling of Aaron, and little more.

According to my parents it's supposed to be pronounced /ærən/ (like the a in "ash") but I guess Aaron is generally pronounced /ɛərən/
(like "air-in") so I'm mostly called that. [Language is fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description) so I let it slide. Whenever people ask, I tell them to pronounce it as they normally would.
