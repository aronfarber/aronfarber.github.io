The name Aron doesn't really mean anything. It's little more than an unusual spelling of Aaron.

According to my parents it's supposed to be pronounced /ærɪn/ (like the a in "ash") but I guess Aaron is pronounced like /ɛrɪn/
(like "air-in") so I'm mostly called that. Language is fluid so I let it slide. Whenever people ask I tell them to pronounce it the way they normally would.
