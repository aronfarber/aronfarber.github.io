Aron is an unusual spelling of Aaron, the name of the [brother of Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron). Etymologically the name originates from Hebrew, although this variant is more often seen in northern Europe. In my case it doesn't hold any cultural or ethnic significance beyond the fact that my parents were able to agree on it.

According to my parents it's supposed to be pronounced /ærən/ (like the a in "ash") but I guess Aaron is generally pronounced /ɛərən/
(like "air-in") so I'm mostly called that. [Language is fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description) so I let it slide. Whenever people ask, I tell them to pronounce it as they normally would.

By virtue of the uncommon spelling, notable Arons are few and far between. There's [Aron Nimzowitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Nimzowitsch), influential Latvian chess player and namesake of the [Nimzowitsch defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzowitsch_Defence). Mayhaps the most well known contemporary Aron is [Aron Ralston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Ralston), who in 2003 was forced to amputate his own arm after being pinned to a wall for five days while traversing a canyon in Utah.

The most renowned Arons of all have been relegated to the middle name, and even then only conditionally. For example, [Yung Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yung_Lean) has it as a middle name (I recommend [Yoshi City](https://soundcloud.com/yung-lean-doer/yung-lean-yoshi-city) for the uninitiated). It was also, most likely mistakenly, Elvis Presley's middle name for some amount of time. Sources provide conflicting information about the logistics, but the consensus seems to be that it was Aron on his birth certificate, and at some point throughout his life he successfully changed it to the biblical spelling.

At one point I had dreams of being a [notable Aron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_(name)) myself, but perhaps not so much nowadays.
