I&amp;rsquo;m an underachiever and having a legacy isn&amp;rsquo;t important to me.
I don&amp;rsquo;t buy into the idea of success or that humans have to achieve big things. What society considers to be big accomplishments are often meaningless in the long run. A lot less meaningful than living a happy life.
However, I&amp;rsquo;m not above bragging a bit about what little I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do so far in life that has made me feel happy.</description></item><item><title>Bicycling</title><link>/bicycling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bicycling/</guid><description>My parents were divorced and lived about 90 minutes apart, so I spent a good deal of time in the car growing up.
I was, and still am, very susceptible to motion sickness, and even the smell of cars induces nausea for me. I was involved in a couple of car accidents growing up, from which I developed anxiety about being in a car, constantly on edge and unable to relax.</description></item><item><title>Identity</title><link>/identity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/identity/</guid><description>Generally I place more weight in personal choices and self-expression than the immutable characteristics people are assigned at birth.
The things I identify with the most are my hobbies, interests, and personal views, many of which are detailed on this website. All of the below is just stuff I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go into because it&amp;rsquo;s a personal website and doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter too much to me.
So yeah, in case you are actually curious about my identity in the traditional sense, I&amp;rsquo;m 21 years old and a he/him identifier.</description></item><item><title>Music</title><link>/music/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/</guid><description>I listen to electronic music pretty much exclusively. None of it is the type of electronic music that&amp;rsquo;s socially acceptable to listen to.
Here are five songs that encapsulate my taste well.
Candid Oak - Grasp Culprate &amp;amp; Dexcell - Poison Distayne - Far Away emelka &amp;amp; Nyah - Land of Lanterns KERO - Rainforest Potentially you&amp;rsquo;ll like one of these.</description></item><item><title>Name</title><link>/name/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/name/</guid><description>The name Aron doesn&amp;rsquo;t really mean anything. It&amp;rsquo;s an unusual spelling of Aaron that my parents gave me because they felt like it.
It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be pronounced /ærɪn/ (like the a in &amp;ldquo;ash&amp;rdquo;) but I guess Aaron is pronounced like /ɛrɪn/ (like &amp;ldquo;air-in&amp;rdquo;) so I&amp;rsquo;m mostly called that. Language is fluid so whatever. Whenever people ask I tell them to pronounce it the way they normally would.
I think if I had a say at the time I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have come up with anything better.</description></item><item><title>NYC</title><link>/nyc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/nyc/</guid><description>I grew up here and consider it my home. If all goes well I&amp;rsquo;ll be living here for the rest of my days.
My great-great-grandparents emigrated here from the Soviet Union in the 1920s when anti-semitism was ramping up throughout Europe.
That story doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter besides the fact that I have an established familial presence in the city and I have the uncommon opportunity to live here into adulthood without paying exorbitant rent.</description></item><item><title>Website</title><link>/website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/website/</guid><description>I have no need for a public website, I just think they&amp;rsquo;re cool. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a company, brand, or social media presence to promote. I&amp;rsquo;m just a guy.
However I do like doing this &amp;ldquo;kind of thing&amp;rdquo; in my spare time. I don&amp;rsquo;t work in tech or develop websites for my job or anything like that. Just a random pursuit I did online because I wanted to. This webpage is kind of pointless but I hope that tells you something about me.</description></item></channel></rss>
