I&amp;rsquo;m an risk-averse underachiever and having a legacy isn&amp;rsquo;t important to me. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not above bragging a bit about what little I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do with my life.
I once biked about 400 miles from Dobbs Ferry, New York to Montreal, Canada. It took a few weeks, and involved camping and carrying associated paraphernelia on my bike.
It would&amp;rsquo;ve been cooler if I did it alone, but it was part of a summer program with a group.</description></item><item><title>aesis</title><link>/music/aesis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/aesis/</guid><description>from: united states

aesis produced my favorite remix of the entirety of disciple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;second biggest remix competition of all time&amp;rdquo; at the age of 13, making him a prodigy in my view. while he did not win, he continues to produce exceptionally boomy dubstep that i really like. his music is filled with ear candy and interesting sound effects, and his flows are unbelievably hard-hitting.</description></item><item><title>au5</title><link>/music/au5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/au5/</guid><description>from: united states

genre-defining, masterful, and impactful are all words i would use to describle au5&amp;rsquo;s music. his trademark combination of well-designed, rolling basses and rich melodic tones is easily recognizable among edm fans. he often features dramatic vocal performances to make each song feel grand and lofty. his sound design and mixing has become renowned, and his unique arrangements have spawned an entire recognizable style that many other artists have emulated in the edm scene.</description></item><item><title>beutnoise</title><link>/music/beutnoise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/beutnoise/</guid><description>from: cuba

the producer who completely revolutionized the genre of dubstep for me. the opposite of repetitive, his music is always chock full of crazy switchups and complex rhythms. his use of high-energy vocal samples adds character to his music, acting as recurring anchors to get me entranced in the flow. on top of that, his mixdowns are some of the cleanest in the scene, allowing for his creative ideas to shine through every song.</description></item><item><title>Bicycling</title><link>/bicycling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bicycling/</guid><description>My parents were divorced and lived about 90 minutes apart, so I spent a good deal of time in the car growing up.

my go-to feel-good producer. candid oak&amp;rsquo;s music strikes a perfect balance between complex, catchy flows and warm, comforting sounds. his songs constantly evolve, rarely staying in one place, making each song feel like an adventure. his organic and nature-inspired percussion, sound design, and vocal sampling are just so unique and never fail to inspire a happy mood within me.</description></item><item><title>criminal code</title><link>/music/criminal-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/criminal-code/</guid><description>from: japan

culprate is something of an og in electronic music, and has been involved in the uk bass music scene since before the 2010s. much of his discography consists of old-school dubstep and a slow, bass-heavy subgenre called neurohop, neither of which i am particularly fond of. however, on certain projects, he brings a mind-bendingly intricate style of glitchy dance music that i just adore.</description></item><item><title>ekcle</title><link>/music/ekcle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/ekcle/</guid><description>from: united kingdom

no producers were able to meld the realms of synthetic and organic sound as well as ekcle. while complex in structure and nuanced in arrangement, they always managed to keep their music sounding warm, inviting, and catchy. their frequent use of the kalimba became an iconic motif cemented in their best songs.</description></item><item><title>hukae</title><link>/music/hukae/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/hukae/</guid><description>from: united kingdom

hukae&amp;rsquo;s tracks feature permanently awkward flows, barebones arrangements, and strange sound design. ultimately, the variation in his ideas, paired with pristine percussion selection, make each hukae track extremely interesting. each track features a slew of subtle choices, such as slight switchups in rhythm or a different snare for a single beat, that keep me engaged throughout every drop.
hukae concocted this unique dubstep style within just the last few years, previously being your average uk riddim artist.</description></item><item><title>Identity</title><link>/identity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/identity/</guid><description>Generally I place more weight in personal choices and self-expression than the immutable characteristics people are assigned at birth.

jkuch has a style completely distinct from any other musician i&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard. all of his sounds are self-processed and he is often his own vocalist, giving his songs a distinct palette that is easily recognizable. his music generally falls under the label of lush and melodic future bass, but his discography is so diverse in ideas that he is easily one of the artists i have spent the most time listening to over the years.</description></item><item><title>lalanoi</title><link>/music/lalanoi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/lalanoi/</guid><description>from: japan

lalanoi&amp;rsquo;s music is pure ear candy. everything he makes is completely beyond my comprehension, yet he somehow manages to combine some mind-boggling flows and arrangements into cohesive pieces. his songs have an insane level of detail that is not only incredibly impressive, but makes his music a delight to listen to every time.

of course, exposure to an artistic medium is prerequisite to attaining prodigial levels of skill.</description></item><item><title>quok</title><link>/music/quok/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/quok/</guid><description>from: russia/czechia

a picture of quok. (image source) quok&amp;rsquo;s music aligns perfectly with my sensibilities. off-kilter beats, frequent glitches and flairs of sound design, and nuanced song structures are all elements of his songs that i enjoy. his production usually isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, and oftentimes his english lyrics are rather odd. his discography contains recurring musical and lyrical motifs that persist across his various albums.</description></item><item><title>reading</title><link>/media/reading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/media/reading/</guid><description>historically, my reading for pleasure has been intermittent. it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big deal when i pick up and finish reading a book. i find that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to commit the contents and message of a book to long-term memory if i write about it, so here&amp;rsquo;s something of a reading log of what i&amp;rsquo;ve read since getting an e-reader in early 2021.

in my opinion, sharks is the best dubstep producer alive currently when it comes to mixing and production quality. his distinct ability to combine sharp drums with layers of insanely complex fluttery synths and basses makes his music hit incredibly hard. his frequent use of vocal samples adds flow and a factor of catchiness to his tracks.
until 2020, the french producer was a slightly above-average dubstep artist who i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have given a second look.</description></item><item><title>valentine</title><link>/music/valentine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/valentine/</guid><description>from: unknown

valentine is a disgraced electronic music producer. i consider her to have been a pioneer of what i call &amp;ldquo;soundcloud future bass&amp;rdquo;, a brand of future bass with more eccentric flows, abrasive sound design, and nostalgic sample choices than more mainstream examples of the genre. her lush, melodic style and frequent featuring of rappers on tracks always appealed to me a lot.</description></item><item><title>voka</title><link>/music/voka/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/music/voka/</guid><description>from: unknown

voka is a very interesting melodic producer. i don&amp;rsquo;t know much about them, and most of their tracks don&amp;rsquo;t specifically resonate with me, but i really enjoy their style of experimental yet euphoric dubstep with metallic textures and tons of variations in flow. this combination reaches its zenith for me in lumina, a beautifully impactful track, especially during those stuttery breaks at the end of each section.</description></item><item><title>Website</title><link>/website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/website/</guid><description>I have no need for a public website, I just think they&amp;rsquo;re cool.
