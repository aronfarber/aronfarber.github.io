i&amp;rsquo;m 20 and i use he/him pronouns. i&amp;rsquo;m currently an environmental engineering student at northeastern. the contents of this website could probably demonstrate more about me than i could succinctly summarize myself. this website:
this is a centralized online location for my thoughts, projects, and reviews that i expect to be viewed sparingly. aron.nyc is a static website built with hugo using the hugo-classic theme and hosted via github pages (but one day i&amp;rsquo;ll self-host it).</description></item><item><title>cars</title><link>/writing/cars/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/writing/cars/</guid><description>originally written in december 2021
rugged individualism is the frequently touted idea that in the united states, you succeed solely on your own merits, accepting no handouts. the philosophy has been steadily ingrained in the american psyche since the conception of the country, which was sold to immigrants as a place where social and economic mobility exists through hard work alone. most will be familiar with the concept by another glamorized term: the &amp;ldquo;american dream&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>ecology</title><link>/projects/ecology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/ecology/</guid><description>originally written in may 2022
despite studying engineering, i think that it&amp;rsquo;s often overemphasized as a panacea to the problems that plague our society. when a system isn&amp;rsquo;t working properly, we resort to technology and innovation to fix the problem for us. there&amp;rsquo;s no greater exemplification of this than the rush to geoengineer ourselves out of climate change.
the current landscape of climate engineering includes technologies such as ocean fertilization and carbon capture that use chemical processes to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</description></item><item><title>keyboard</title><link>/projects/keyboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/keyboard/</guid><description>originally written in december 2021
these days, a significant portion of human uptime is spent on a screen, whether it be for work, academia, or even leisure. over the past year i&amp;rsquo;ve taken an interest in optimizing my online efficiency to reduce the time i need to spend online. i reckoned with this by attempting to master the devices that are responsible for bridging the interactional gap between us and our computers: keyboards.</description></item><item><title>materials</title><link>/projects/materials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/materials/</guid><description>originally written in december 2021
for my materials class in the fall 2021 semester, students were assigned the task of designing and conducting a semester-long lab experiment to test the mechanical properties of a material of our choosing. due to my newfound obsession with keyboards, i decided to test thermoplastics, as they are commonly used in keyboard switches. ultimately, it was a valuable first foray into engineering lab experience. being able to interface with genuine lab equipment and use real data to write a scientific paper was a pretty fulfilling experience.</description></item><item><title>privacy</title><link>/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/privacy/</guid><description>privacy is a human right, whether it be in real life or on the internet. to reflect that, this website does not track, gather information about, or profile its users in any way. feel free to browse this website without limits; your activity will be completely unmonitored.

each title links to my more in-depth review of the book.</description></item></channel></rss>
