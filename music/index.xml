a picture of rapper/producer quok. (image source) musically, quok aligns perfectly with my sensibilities. off-kilter beats, frequent glitches and flairs of sound design, and nuanced song structures are all elements of his songs that i enjoy. his production usually isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, and oftentimes his english lyrics can be rather odd.</description></item></channel></rss>
