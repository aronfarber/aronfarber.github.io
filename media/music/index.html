<a href=https://soundcloud.com/quok>soundcloud</a>, <a href=https://quok.bandcamp.com>bandcamp</a></p><p>quok&rsquo;s music aligns perfectly with my sensibilities. off-kilter beats, frequent glitches and flairs of sound design, and nuanced song structures are all elements of his songs that i enjoy. his production usually isn&rsquo;t perfect, and oftentimes his english lyrics are rather odd. his discography contains recurring musical and lyrical motifs that persist across his various albums. in my eyes these traits are eccentric, but they only add to the character and uniqueness of his style.</p><p>nowadays, he mostly releases under куок, a russian rap alias that i still quite enjoy due to the presence of his production. he seems to be relatively popular in russia as a rapper, and he still maintains a decent following in the soundcloud scene from his days as an electronic artist. however, i do often yearn for another instrumental quok album, since his last one under the alias was <a href=https://quok.bandcamp.com/album/genesis>genesis</a>, in 2019.</p><p><a href=https://quok.bandcamp.com/track/invisible-friend-2>invisible friend</a> (2016) -

<a href=https://soundcloud.com/ekclemusic>soundcloud</a>, <a href=https://ekclemusic.bandcamp.com/>bandcamp</a></p><p>no producers were able to meld the realms of synthetic and organic sound as well as ekcle. while complex in structure and nuanced in arrangement, they always managed to keep their music sounding warm, inviting, and catchy. their frequent use of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbira>kalimba</a> became an iconic motif cemented in their best songs. at one point, i&rsquo;d probably have considered them my favorite artists, and their last ep <a href=https://soundcloud.com/inspected/sets/ekcle-yoja>yoja</a> remains my favorite ever to be released.</p><p>ekcle were a duo from the uk. in 2020, they announced that they would be splitting, thereby ending the project indefinitely. the two went on to start their own solo projects (<a href=https://soundcloud.com/tutarapeak>tutara peak</a> and <a href=https://soundcloud.com/davidgothammusic>david gotham</a>), but i haven&rsquo;t enjoyed either of their individual outputs nearly as much as their efforts under ekcle. at least this way, they have cemented an incredibly consistent catalog that will maintain a legendary status within electronic music.</p><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/ekclemusic/treading-the-floors-of-the-sky>treading the floors of the sky</a> (2018) with <a href=https://soundcloud.com/owsey>owsey</a> -
