kind of just living life after losing most of his mental faculties in an accident. the book is structured with chapters alternating between these two characters&rsquo; perspectives. ultimately, kafka succumbs to the curse and nakata suddenly falls asleep and never wakes up.</p><p>when i started reading this book i was enjoying myself. the introduction of so many unexplained mysteries seemed to be promising a complex story that would ultimately converge in a satisfying payoff. prosaically, it&rsquo;s a well-written book. for those first 20 or so chapters, this was a 7/10.</p><p>however, as i kept reading it became abundantly clear that the untied loose ends in the book were nothing more than plotholes. i was enthralled in trying to understand plot points that would end up not mattering at all. i enjoy books that use abstractions as an analogue for real subjects and themes. however, i couldn&rsquo;t find meaning, or anything real for that matter, in this book.</p><p>near the end of the book there was a stretch of about 15 chapters in which pretty much nothing happened. the main and supporting characters just kind of went about the world doing absolutely nothing. it was midway through this section that i realized something that put me off of not only this book, but the author, murakami.</p><p>for context, this book is filled with fanservice. classical music and vinyl records, esoteric philosophy and obscure japanese authors, and the importance of self-sufficiency and exercise are injected into every corner of this book. it&rsquo;s a standard nerdy male introvert set of topics (supported by the occasional &ldquo;sports bad&rdquo; interjection). mildly pretentious, but overall excusable.</p><p>this really emphasized to me how much murakami wrote these characters as an extension of himself. however, also in this book: kafka&rsquo;s dialectical mentor sympathizes with the mastermind behind the holocaust, adolf eichmann; some &ldquo;sjw&rdquo; caricatures walked into kafka&rsquo;s library and proceeded to get triggered and owned; kafka sexually assaults his sister on multiple occasions because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s fate&rdquo; and &ldquo;he&rsquo;s cursed&rdquo;; and some cats get graphically killed and tortured by kafka&rsquo;s dad. novels can have immoral characters, yes, but this book barely even has characters. it&rsquo;s just murakami.</p><p>ultimately, kafka on the shore is well written and there&rsquo;s certainly a set of people who will find solace and immersion in the places murakami takes the reader. to me, the message was nonexistent, the plot was ultimately pretty boring, and i could tell i was not the target audience throughout the read. however, this book did maintain the illusion that it contained meaningful themes for surprisingly long, during which i found this book much more enjoyable.</p><p>rating: 4/10</p><p><a href=#log>>> back to the reading log</a></p><a href=/>>> home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr><a href=/web-philosophy/>My web philosophy</a> | <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sebastianvydra/nothingtofear>Song recommendation</a></footer></body></html>
