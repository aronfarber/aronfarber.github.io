I rarely watch TV or movies. It&rsquo;s weird because I&rsquo;ll enthusiastically watch a 2-hour-long Youtube video but the idea of sitting down for a feature film with an infinitely higher budget and production quality is too much to ask.</p><p>However, I did watch Breaking Bad in high school and loved it. It&rsquo;s my favorite TV show from sheer lack of experience.</p><p>If I had to name a favorite movie I still wouldn&rsquo;t be able to. I haven&rsquo;t sought out a movie in years. I think I just have trouble suspending my disbelief and getting immersed in a story that I&rsquo;m not interacting with.</p><p>Books are pretty cool, when I can make time to read them. I&rsquo;m very visual about reading and tend to construct really lucid visions of the events of a story in my head as I read, which is enjoyable. Again, commitment issues hold me back when it comes to books, and I don&rsquo;t read as much as I should. Of what I&rsquo;ve managed to read, my favorite book is The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers. I also enjoy short stories or novellas on occasion.</p><p>Non-fiction I can do without because I&rsquo;d almost always rather just read a Wikipedia article. There&rsquo;s no need for a grand narrative in most books that are supposed to just be factual.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t read the news either. Being informed is nice (I do this sub-optimally through the Wikipedia front page and by talking to my mom) but also the 24-hour news cycle makes for an abundance of really low-quality journalism and it&rsquo;s more effort sorting through the rubble than I&rsquo;m willing to put in.</p><p>Online media tends to be cool. Not just Youtube videos, but also blog posts, websites, and even forums if you can count those.</p><p>However, I don&rsquo;t watch Twitch or any livestream content. It&rsquo;s just too much especially when every streamer I care about uploads the highlights to Youtebe anyway. I&rsquo;m also not into the parasocial thing; when I have watched livestreams out of sheer boredom I&rsquo;ve stayed far away from the chat box.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t really care at all about art. The only observations I can make about a painting or a sculpture are, &ldquo;looks cool&rdquo;, or more commonly in art museums, &ldquo;what am I looking at&rdquo;. The history behind artistic movements can be interesting but that&rsquo;s about it.</p><p>The same goes for most interpretive media. Dance, poetry, stand-up comedy; not into it. Even books with overly symbolic messaging, like the Lord of the Flies type books I&rsquo;d be assigned in middle school, are a slog for me.</p><p>Theater and improv, while special to me because I performed them for quite a while, are still unpleasant to watch.</p><p>Another thing I don&rsquo;t watch is sports. I feel like I understand the draw of sports and why people are so invested in them, but I didn&rsquo;t grow up watching sports and don&rsquo;t have any of the requisite background knowledge that makes each game interesting. When contextualized, the history behind some sports and events can be fascinating. If every televised game had a story like in a Jon Bois production, I&rsquo;d be a sports fan.</p><p>Oh, and I <em>promise</em> I don&rsquo;t like anime. Yes, I&rsquo;ve tried watching it.</p><p>If I missed anything it means I care so little about it that I forgot about it.</p><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr><a href=https://aron.nyc/website/>About this website</a> | Thanks for visiting!</footer></body></html>
