I&rsquo;m an underachiever and having a legacy isn&rsquo;t important to me. However, I&rsquo;m not above bragging a bit about what little I&rsquo;ve managed to do so far.</p><ul><li><p>I once <a href=/bicycling>biked</a> about 400 miles from Dobbs Ferry, New York to Montreal, Canada. It took a few weeks, and involved camping and carrying associated paraphernelia on my bike.</p><p>It would&rsquo;ve been cooler if I did it alone, but it was part of a summer program with a group. I enjoy the prospect of solo adventure and one of my only ambitious goals in life is to one day go bikepacking on my own and camp in the woods.</p></li><li><p>At one point I got the world record in Timed Course #2 in &ldquo;Papers, Please&rdquo;, which is one of my favorite <a href=/games>video games</a> and the origin of my avatar on this site&rsquo;s <a href=/>homepage</a>.</p><p>I might still be tied for it. As of right now me and another person have 44 and two other people have 47, disregarding the obvious hacked scores on the leaderboard. 47 is technically possible but would require extremely good luck on top of perfect play, so those scores might be achieved with aid. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/PapersPlease/leaderboards/179544?sr=1">Here&rsquo;s</a> the leaderboard if you&rsquo;re curious (external link to Steam).</p></li><li><p>I have one of the largest independent archives of <a href=/music>electronic music</a> from Soundcloud. It&rsquo;s over 10 terabytes of music. Music that not many people care about besides me.</p></li><li><p>I also know all of the flags and capitals of the world by memory. At one point I was really good at Geoguessr but the meta moved so quickly that after I stopped playing for a year my skill level was superceded by the pros. Now I just <a href=/media>watch the pros</a> instead of playing.</p></li></ul><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr>This website is <a href=https://github.com/thegithubrespectorhasloggedon/thegithubrespectorhasloggedon.github.io>open-source</a> | <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sebastianvydra/nothingtofear>Song recommendation</a></footer></body></html>
