I don&rsquo;t really buy into the idea of being successful, and having a legacy isn&rsquo;t important to me. However, I&rsquo;m not above bragging a bit about the cool things I&rsquo;ve managed to do with my life.</p><ul><li><p>I once <a href=/bicycling>biked</a> about 400 miles from Dobbs Ferry, New York to Montreal, Canada. It took a few weeks, and involved camping and carrying associated paraphernelia on my bike.</p><p>It would&rsquo;ve been cooler if I did it alone, but it was part of a summer program with a group. I enjoy the prospect of solo adventure and one of my only ambitious goals in life is to one day go bikepacking on my own and camp in the woods.</p></li><li><p>At one point I got the world record in Timed Course #2 in &ldquo;Papers, Please&rdquo;, which is one of my favorite video games and the origin of my avatar on this site&rsquo;s <a href=/>homepage</a>.</p><p>As of right now I&rsquo;m tied for 3rd with a score of 44. The two people tied for 1st have 47. 47 is possible but would require extremely good luck on top of perfect play, so I haven&rsquo;t committed to attempting it yet. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/PapersPlease/leaderboards/179544?sr=1">Here&rsquo;s</a> the leaderboard if you&rsquo;re curious (external link to Steam).</p></li><li><p>I maintain a massive independent archive of <a href=/music>electronic music</a> from Soundcloud. It&rsquo;s over 10 terabytes of audio files. Soundcloud EDM is fickle and songs disappear all the time, so I&rsquo;m pretending to be a preservationist or archivist. Really I&rsquo;m just a data hoarder.</p></li><li><p>I also know all of the flags and capitals of the world by memory. At one point I was really good at Geoguessr but the meta moved so quickly that after I stopped playing for a year my skill level was superceded by pro players.</p></li></ul><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr>This website is <a href=https://github.com/thegithubrespectorhasloggedon/thegithubrespectorhasloggedon.github.io>open-source</a> | <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sebastianvydra/nothingtofear>Song recommendation</a></footer></body></html>
