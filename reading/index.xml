kafka on the shore is something of a coming-of-age novel following two separate storylines: a child named kafka who is trying to escape an oedipus-esque curse, and an old man named nakata who is&amp;hellip; kind of just living life after losing most of his mental faculties in an accident. the book is structured with chapters alternating between these two characters&amp;rsquo; perspectives.</description></item></channel></rss>
